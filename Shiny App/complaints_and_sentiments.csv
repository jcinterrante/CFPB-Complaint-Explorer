It should be noted it was only on XXXX. We contacted XXXX & Wells Fargo bank to report the fraudulent accounts. They did confirm it was my SS # on file but with someone elses name, DOB, and address. We filled out fraud forms, send police report number, and copies of credit reports. On XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX I received letters from both Wells Fargo & XXXX stating it was discovered to be identity theft and they would have the 3 credit bureaus remove from my credit file. I also placed a freeze on my credit files. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a few voicemails from SS office stating my identity may have been compromised yet again. I pulled credit reports again and was shocked to see XXXX  is reporting my file as XXXX XXXX XXXX, his DOB, Addresses, XXXX XXXX is running inquiries ( I dont have ), Wells Fargo credit card is showing closed as of XX/XX/XXXX, last payment XX/XX/XXXX, shows consumer disputes, and last reported XX/XX/XXXX. None of this is mine and was to be removed. 

This person is clearly using my SS # according to XXXX & Wells Fargo. XXXX did their job and removed it for Fraud. Wells Fargo has not. How did a large national bank such as Wells Fargo allow someone to open a credit card in my name without the proper verification. Clearly the other persons name and DOB ( XX/XX/XXXX ) does not match my SS #. Where is the verification on that?

3169014,2019-03-04,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,NA,"I am filing this complaint after receiving a letter from Chase today alleging a lie to cover up their illegal activities. In the letter ( see attachment ) dated XX/XX/XXXX Chase asserted that we cant consider you for mortgage assistance because we didnt receive your initial request by the required number of days before the scheduled foreclosure date. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE. I REPEAT. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE, AND I CAN PROVE IT! 
Chase has repeatedly made false allegations like this to us for more than four years. Most of the Chase Request for Mortgage Assistance applications we have sent to Chase have been ignored ( see attachment ). Nonetheless, In XX/XX/XXXX, our Chase dedicated relationship manager in XXXX, Florida spoke to the Chase branch bank manager and vice president in XXXX, Georgia. He ( the vice president ) told her ( our dedicated relationship manager ) that he personally faxed all of our documents to her the previous week and confirmed their receipt in her office at that time. In spite of this fact, she requested through the branch bank vice president that we submit our application and all required documents to her again for the 33rd time in 18 months ( see attachment ). Consequently, our dedicated relationship manager sent to our home address a XXXX envelope for us to submit our application and documents back to her again. We sealed the documents in that envelope and took it back to the Chase branch bank so that Chase employees could send it to her through XXXX. 
The Chase branch bank in XXXX, Georgia took receipt of our envelope of documents and gave them to XXXX. XXXX tracking confirms that our application was received by our dedicated relationship manager in her actual office on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( see attachment ). After that date, we never heard from our dedicated relationship manager again regarding ANY aspect of our application. 
Chase proceeded in XXXX to schedule a foreclosure on our property for XX/XX/XXXX in violation of the laws of our state for multiple reasons, including failure to provide proper notification as required by law. As such, this proves the statement made by Chase to us in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX is a lie because we submitted our Request for Mortgage Assistance application to Chase more than thirty days before Chase took illegal action to attempt a foreclosure on the date of XX/XX/XXXX. Our "" dedicated relationship manager '' failed to process our application despite our having previously submitted it to her in XX/XX/XXXX, and well as on 32 previous occasions in the past 18 months.",NA,JPMORGAN CHASE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,GA,305XX,852218,3025285000000,OCC,2253482000000,270060000000,Washington,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-37

I was unable to log into my account online to make the payment because Macy 's had updated the system and I simply did n't have the patience to navigate their irritating and obscure system. However, I called Macy 's and paid my bill for $ XXXX a day or two late - was assured that there would be no late charges because I was a customer in good standing, yada yada, and received a confirmation number that I had paid the bill in full. 

I then received a bill for {$2.00} in interest. OK, I agree - I had n't paid the {$140.00} on time, regardless of the reason. Whatever. So I paid that {$2.00} bill immediately, by check, and left the country for an extended absence - in complete confidence that I had paid all my bills in full. 

Imagine my surprise when I returned to the US and found that Macy 's had received and cashed my check, but charged me a further {$2.00} anyway as a minimum interest charge on the interest charge that had been paid in full, well before the due date. Oh, and then added a further minimum {$2.00} charge for a total of {$4.00}, due on XXXX. 

I called Macy 's right away and spoke to one XXXX, who did n't seem to have a clue why I was irritated, but eventually - very grudgingly and with full implication that I was a total deadbeat - agreed that she would "" waive '' the {$4.00}.

Before doing so Barclay Card assured me that she could be a user and that it would have no impact on her credit. Only I was responsible for all charges on the account. She never signed anything. I asked for her to be added as an authorized signer to my account. BarclayCard sent her a card of her own to use. About XX/XX/XXXX she was finished with her need to use my credit card and I removed her as a user. 

She went to check her credit bureau the other day and found Barclay Card to be reporting MY full balance to her credit report. She called Barclay Card and they said they could not talk with her about it since she is not a signer on the account. I called Barclay Card to have it corrected and they said that I had to submit letter, via regular mail, and all of the supporting documentation to have my daughters credit reporting reversed. 

Their fraudulent mistake is not my problem to fix. Barclay Card acknowledges that they should not be reporting on my daughters credit report. They should not have reported it to her credit bureau while she was using the card and they certainly should not be reporting it now. However, they said they will maintain the fraudulent reporting unless I write them a letter with all the required documentation to have it removed.

Specifically, Chase limited the number of guests allowed with the XXXX  XXXX airline lounge benefit and also disallowed points earning on the {$300.00} in travel charges each year that normally result in travel credits. 

Under the terms of the agreement, I could refuse to accept these changes - which I did. I called Chase to request that my card type be changed to one without an annual fee and that the annual fee be refunded. 

Despite making this request 4-5 times, the request was not processed.

They stated they canceled the balance owed on XX/XX/XXXX and issued a XXXX. and as a result updated charge off balance to {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and reported to credit bureaus on XX/XX/XXXX.

Further they state they carefully reviewed the account and did not find any misrepresentations, unfair tactics or tried to be deceiving.

And that they are required to report accurately.

The problem with these statements are my credit report shows a charge off in the payment history on XX/XX/XXXX. Then the next data entry shows a charge off on XX/XX/XXXX.

The status shows a balance update and status of charge off update to be XX/XX/XXXX when they clearly said in the letter the balance was canceled on XX/XX/XXXX. If the balance is {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX it should state XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX.

The next problem is the XXXX they furnished in the letter and sent to the irs shows an identifiable event code of ( F ) By Agreement. This would have to mean that I made an agreement with them to cancel the debt owed for less than the full balance. This would be false.

The date of the Identifiable event is XX/XX/XXXX. Considering the Irs regulations prior to XX/XX/XXXX. If a debt has not been paid for 36 months and active collection is not pursued then a XXXX is to be issued even if the debt is not discharged. The account was delinquent prior to XX/XX/XXXX and closed and charged off XX/XX/XXXX. A XXXX should have been issued prior to XX/XX/XXXX. So in this case the XXXX was issued in the wrong year with incorrect event coding Finally according to XXXX  county land records there was a mortgage assignment filed for this account. The Assignment of mortgage was not to Chase Home Finance nor Chase Home Lending. Which gives reason to believe the incorrect creditor is reporting the debt and that they do not have a valid claim. Whether the Assignment of mortgage is valid is speculative considering the notary had been suspended and the agent on behalf of Chase may or may not have worked for Chase.

My actions have been contacting Chase about the misrepresentations and they have stated the account has been charged off since XX/XX/XXXXbut it is still open and they are reporting correctly.

I disputed with Credit Reporting Agencies to validate the information which is clearly incorrect. The came back that they only report what they are told to and that it was validated.

I have submitted a prior complaint to CFPB which contacted Chase which responded with the letter that I have explained.

I have continually ran into problems getting credit due to this account reporting the charge off as XX/XX/XXXX since Derogatory Credit waiting periods require 4 years though the Charge Off had occurred XX/XX/XXXX.

Initially I was unable to use my card for several months upon credit approval. Several attempts to contact hsbc and several hours of being put on hold and hung up on lead to my initial complaint.

Now, I have completed the online banking months ago as well to manage my account. HSBCs initial classificationof my account has caused me not to have the ability to log on, I have also stopped receiving paper letters in the mail showing me my statement. Since opening I have made one payment over the phone for the complete balance. However now I do not know the remaining payments or due dates which is preventing me to make my payment and ensure I have a XXXX  balance. 

I hurt my credit by opening this account with the intention of using rewards points, benefiting from the annual match of points, using my rewards points, and benefiting from the 0 % transfer. 

I was forced to open an additional card to perform the balance transfer, further harming my credit score. I am unable to use my rewards points because I can not log online. I have been prevented from using my card for several months limiting the benefit I would receive in rewards points and more importantly the annual match. I can not make a payment on this account due to unknown balances which I have never had a late payment and am afraid this may occur due to the mismanagement of opening this account. 

In addition to the hours spent already in the aforementioned complaint I spent additional hours trying to fix my online banking issues.

I have recorded conversations with bank employees, recorded with their consent, explicitly stating that the feature was removed due to low funding levels in my account, though no official guidelines were ever presented to me, despite multiple requests. My complaint is split into two parts : 1. ) Chase Bank utilized predatory tactics to remove mobile deposit from consumers who would most benefit from the feature. I was forced to incur heavy overdraft fees, many of which were returned when bank employees agreed that fees were caused exclusively due to the removal of that feature. After multiple instances when the bank agreed with my complaints and reversed fees, they continued agreeing but no longer had the capacity to reverse the charges. In one instance, when the city of XXXX was completely flooded and no street access existed to banks or atms, I was still charged a fee, even when I showed the ability to make a deposit as soon as the streets became accessible. Instances such as this occurred on numerous occasions, and each time employees told me that my feature had been removed due to a history of overdrafts, which was entirely created as a result of the removal, itself. This policy of removing the feature for customers with low or negative balances puts us into a purposeful loop of overdraft fees, which bank employees acknowledged as a known problem. 

2. ) I asked on numerous occasions to be given written or formal guidelines about my rights, as a consumer to utilize the mobile deposit feature. While in my recordings bank employees give vastly different answers about the terms of use, none could provide me with clear written rules. Who qualifies for that feature? When will mine be turned on? Why was the feature removed as a result of overdraft fees? All indicated that the feature was removed due to low funds or overdrafts, but none could explain why removal came as a consequence of those facts. Several employees agreed that this was an unfair practice and indicated that numerous customers called in with similar complaints over time. The second portion of my complaint is thus about the bank 's lack of transparency about customer terms of use. 

My recorded conversations with employees are from XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/2016, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, and XX/XX/16.

This overdrew my account on the following Tuesday and because I was out of town and not working at the time, I had to wait 2 weeks for a paycheck to bring my account back to balance. I accrued over a XXXX dollars in overdraft and NSF fees and have records to prove this. I called PNC multiple times and asked of anything could be done to stop this with zero help. I was transferred to a supervisor department after the 1st employees claimed they could not reverse any of the fees as the system would not let them. The phone rang once and I got an automated message that said no one was available and the call automatically ended. Never called back. Accepting that they would not budge to work with me or help me at all, I paid the fees and brought my account back to positive and moved on. 

Fast forward to today. The company I work for has decided to switch to biweekly pay instead of weekly. These past 2 weeks on one weeks pay have been awful and stressful. However, we managed to make it to Thursday XX/XX/19 without overdrawing. My account was negative XXXX dollars on Thursday XX/XX/19. When I woke up on Friday XX/XX/19 my account was negative XXXX because of a few small transactions that went through and XXXX dollars in overdraft fees 3 XXXX  dollar charges each. So, my paycheck finally hit the account for XXXX dollars on Friday XX/XX/19. Then at XXXX on Saturday XX/XX/19 I was charged 3 more XXXX dollar overdraft fees after my paycheck had already hit the account. Because my paycheck has gone through I did not expect this. I have so many bills coming out this week from having to wait 2 weeks to get paid, that I can not afford XXXX dollars in overdraft fees. This is my whole grocery budget for the next 2 weeks until I get paid again and I literally have no food in my apartment. I called again today XX/XX/19 asking for assistance in this especially because my paycheck had hit and there is no reason for the fees to be met with no help again and told I should use tips to avoid overdrafting. Enough is enough of this. Ive paid so much in overdraft fees that I can't afford to live. All I want was the 3 most recent overdraft fees refunded to me so I can afford groceries so I don't starve without over drafting again and having the same thing happen while I wait another 2 weeks to get paid. I have exhausted all options to avoid this. I have overdraft protection on my account. I have alerts sent to me when my account drops below XXXX dollars. The way PNC does their business makes it impossible to avoid this because it happens over night while you are sleeping and then to offer no solution to a good, 6 year customer is frustrating and disheartening.",NA,PNC BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,WI,531XX,817824,463097309000,OCC,380920825000,46007120000,Washington,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-33

I did not ask for this to happen, neither did I want to do business with M & T Bank, although I realized the sale was legal. 

The email notice said that I "" would not have to change any of the terms '' of my payments and simply continue as I had been doing, the only change being payments made to M & T Bank rather than XXXX. On Friday, XX/XX/2019, I received a 2nd email notice from M & T Bank basically stating the exact same thing. 

For the last 5 or more years, I had been making my XXXX XXXX payments through my XXXX XXXX Bill Payment System ( see attachments ). Payments were being made at least twice a month or every two ( 2 ) weeks consistently. I have NEVER made payments late in over 10 years with any mortgage payment and usually make the 2nd payment in a month ( prior month to due date ) at least 1 to 3 days early. My wife and I earn over {$180000.00} per year and do not have any issues making any debt payment!

At the time the transfer became effective, I had already paid XXXX XXXX  for the month of XXXX as I always due before the end of the previous month. M & T Bank sent me a bill not giving me credit for XX/XX/2019 payments that had already been made to XXXX XXXX prior to the transfer. Secondly, since I thought this was an error, I waited for a corrected statement. Instead, I received a pass due notice when my XXXX payment was not even due! 

I called M & T Bank on last Friday, XX/XX/2019 and explained everything above to the representative. Instead of assisting me with the issue, she kept giving me the run around and telling me that I had "" to change the way I was paying by logging on and signing up for their every-two-week payment bank draft ''. This was a direct contradiction to what I had been guaranteed in writing that I would NOT have to change the way I had been paying my mortgage properly for years. Secondly, she did nothing to bring my mortgage account current as it should be. 

Lastly, I just received by mail another pass due notice stating that I owe {$2900.00}, when in fact, I OWE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! The M & T Bank bill also included some {$920.00} "" Hazard Disbursement '' amount, which has never appeared on any previous mortgage bill, and they never explained it to me. 

My payments are current, and documentation is attached to prove it! If I were not late with XXXX XXXX, how could I now be late with M & T Bank when I have continued to make all payments twice a month or even every two weeks right through their transfer of mortgage process, for which again, I did not ask nor desire? 

This is absolutely ridiculous, and I expect the federal government to take the strongest possible action against this bank. They did not even listen to me or even try to correct the situation. I have been a perfect customer, I always pay all bills on time ( my credit score proves that ), and I will not tolerate this harassment in the lease.

I took out two mortgages for the condo at 80 % on first and 20 % on second. XXXX XXXX was an operating sub of XXXX and both were taken over by Bank of America in XXXX. 

In XXXX I was contacted by Bank of America via mail that I was eligible for loan modifications under the HAMP program. I contacted the using the number on the letter. The agent that I spoke to informed me that I would be eligible but first I needed to quit paying my mortgages. She stated that I needed to contact her in 3 months after non-payment. 

In three months the agent informed me that she would be sending out a modification package in the mail. Upon receiving it I filled it out and she informed me to continue to not pay my mortgages. Several months later in XXXX I received my modification package. The principal on the mortgage was {$110000.00} which was XXXX higher than the original 1st. I asked the agent about the 2nd mortgage and if I would be getting another bill. She replied that as far as she was concerned the 2nd was finished and that I was to ignore any and all bills for the property except the one sent by bank of america. She additionally stated that I would be receiving information in the future settling the 2nd mortgage and that it was going to be extinguished and discharged. She stated that I would be receiving a XXXX for the difference if there was one. 

During the modification process all financial adjustments and payments were reported on bills that were consistent with the XXXX XXXX XXXX statements. Upon completion of the trial period and upon transferring over to bank of america bills for the mortgage I received a statement from XXXX XXXX with regards to the 2nd mortgage that showed that the balance was adjusted to XXXX. It was dated in conjunction to the billing reflected on the first mortgage and the bank of america modification. 

I never received any bill with regard to the 2nd mortgage after the modification was completed. 3-4 years later I received a bill in the mail from a third party company that has been trying to collect. I emphatically deny the legitimacy of this debt. 

At the recorder of deeds it shows that the deed of trust assignment for the first mortgage was transferred to bank of america in XXXX of XXXX yet the 2nd mortgage has remained unchanged since XXXX. 

Upon conducting a title search it is clear that bank of america owns the 2nd mortgage still. I have tried to reach out via phone and email to bank of america only to get canned responses. 

I understand that in the early days of HAMP bank of america was contracting with third party companies to administrate the modifications. I also understand that these companies had poorly trained staff. I speculate that it is quit possible that while the third party organized the information and handed it back to bank of america that it is likely that the documentation was lost or incorrectly filed and that the 2nd mortgage was sold as an unsecured debt to a third party. 

I understand that in XXXX there was a settlement with the department of justice in which bank of america had to correct and amend several decisions that it had made as its practices were in violation of the HAMP program. I would greatly appreciate if Bank of America would take the necessary steps to reply to these issues responsibly so that this can come to a close.

The dispute came from fees they assessed against my account. I always pay my bill in full, and they suddenly charged over {$50.00} in interest one month. I discovered later that they did this because they accidentally posted a payment on my account, and they charged me interest for three months from the time they posted the payment until they discovered the error. During these 3 months, I had been paying the full amount on my bill by the due date. 

When I discovered Barclays ' error, I made the payment in the amount that they had posted, but I contested the amount of interest because it was not my fault.

'' I stopped using my Barclays credit card, started making arrangements to get a new credit card, and I used {$75.00} in "" rewards '' to reduce my balance. Then, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that stated that they had posted {$29.00} in "" interest charge-purchases '' on my account on XX/XX/XXXX. The amount was the balance on my account, not the fees/interest that Barclays had charged on my account. Regardless, upon receiving that letter, I wrote a check in amount of {$29.00}, returned my credit card, and asked them to close my account, with the hope that I would no longer deal with Barclays.

OnXX/XX/XXXX, Capital One then simultaneously refunded me the three charges of {$110.00}, {$110.00} and {$85.00} while additionally charging me three charges of {$110.00}, {$110.00} and {$85.00}. In effect, I was still charged the money that was supposed to be returned.

The last call was XX/XX/XXXX. The fraud agents name was XXXX. Her ID # was XXXX. She told me that everyone else was wrong and that it takes an entire billing cycle to fix this problem.

The billing cycle ended XX/XX/XXXX, approximately one month after I placed my fraud report. I paid the bill in full. No action has been taken to refund my money.

When you call the fraud line you have to talk to someone before being put through to a fraud agent. I asked the person who put me through to XXXX  on the final call to file a complaint on my behalf. He told me that he did ; although, I have not heard anything about it from Capital One. Each phone call with Capital One takes at least 40 minutes. I do not have time to keep calling them just to hear why they can not follow their own protocol.

I would like for XXXX XXXX to refund the money to my account or to send me a check for the money owed. The money owed is the difference between the three XXXX charges ( {$110.00}, {$110.00} and {$85.00} ) and the two XXXX credits ( {$44.00} and {$44.00} ). This equals {$220.00}.",NA,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORP,MD,208XX,112837,363521558000,OCC,303536222000,42232353000,Washington,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-58

I already disputed this with the credit bureaus and they verified it as being accurate. I am not sure how this happened, I |thought that I had made my payments to you on time when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me or maybe an error occurred where it wasn't recorded on time. 

I do ask in light of the good standing relationship we have that you remove any late payments from my credit report and refund me any late fees that were added to my account. I do not believe it is accurate. 

I would rather not have to spend more time than necessary for both of us to resolve this situation so I was hoping that instead of escalating anything, that you could help me with this and report me as being 100 % on time.

We are seniors and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX MA XXXX, has been our primary residence since XX/XX/XXXX. We purchased our home on no doc through Washington Mutual. Chase took over the loan in XX/XX/XXXX and we refinanced from a 30 year fixed to a 15 year fixed mortgage Chase in XX/XX/XXXX. At the closing, Chase asked if we wanted a $ XXXX line of credit. We elected to accept only $ XXXX at the time, which was not accessed until XX/XX/XXXX. In  late XX/XX/XXXX, Chase invited us to increase our HELOC line from the $ XXXX to $ XXXX, but at an increase of 2 % on the entire balance. Going through the financial crisis causing negative Government effect on my FCC Broadcast ownership, XXXX and XXXX children in college, we accepted going forward with the new terms. Chase then delayed for months stating our home value decreased and despite adequate funds in the bank and questioned amount of money I was taking from my owned radio station XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MA. In XX/XX/XXXX, Chase finally dictated to us that our only option was modification but we had to skip two payments to be considered. 

Chase then reported us to the credit bureaus and the modification approval for the stated 60 months finally came in XX/XX/XXXX, but extended only 42 months with a balloon payment for the full mortgage due XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, Chase miscoded a bank routing number on a payment and then took months to determine it was their error. Then, Chase interrupted our applications for new financing by starting foreclosure notices. Chase further delayed and hindered our efforts to change lenders. 

Finally, after finally being put in touch with the Chase Executive Office in XX/XX/XXXX,  Chase agreed, in XX/XX/XXXX to a second modification at our out of pocket cost of {$36000.00}. Chase refused to spread that amount over the ensuing 200 payments in the second modification. 

In both XX/XX/XXXX and upon our XX/XX/XXXX approval of the second modification, Chase promised to A ) adjust late fees, interest charges and legal fees, B ) make sure the credit bureaus knew we were up to date on the mortgage & HELOC, C ) correct Chases superficial appraisal of our home which is at least $ XXXX too low - $ XXXX compared to a complete modification performed by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at $ XXXX - and D ) make arrangements to finally add to our line of credit. E ) The rate of interest on the new modification is quite high, 4.87 %. 

We continue to get lip service, run around, rude correspondence and phone conversation from Chase. The letters they have sent to me and your offices have no credibility as they do not address Chase mistakes and the horrible, inappropriate manner of customer service from Chase. The Chase letters repeat their old decisions that were incorrect in the first place. 

We are seniors, never bankrupt, with a Chase debt of less than $ XXXX on our primary/only residence HUD and the CPB valued several months ago at over {$1.00} million. Chase is disregarding the importance of our Senior Financial Health and discriminating against seniors ability to have simple access to less than 49 % of their home equity for medical, improvement, college and living expenses. Further, Chase has been rude and tremendously challenged in delaying proceedings. Chase representatives stall, take months to say its not this department and have told us to find another lender, get a reverse mortgage or move! 

With a tremendous amount of phone, email, letter, fax correspondence shared with your offices and Chase, I must ask that you now step in and hold Chase accountable for this harmful, stressful, prolonged and costly behavior negatively affecting us, and other senior customers. We ask for all fee and interest adjustments and for a favorable arrangement to have access to up to 49 % of our home FMV, without further delay.

I have waited for more than 10 days, I was like maybe something went wrong with the merchant so I contacted them and they said usually this takes 3-20 business days, so I'm satisfied and moved on with my month, 30 days passed and still, nothing is happening.

We provided all requested documentation and were approved, and given a lower monthly payment on a 90 day trial period. No information was given as to how they arrived at this payment, or what would happen for them to achieve this payment amount, until AFTER we paid 3 months of trial payments. 

We made the first two trial period payments and Wells Fargo sent us a letter that we'd been removed from the program. I called them and found out they had sent us a letter that we had to sign and send back agreeing to the trial period. They didn't tell us it would be coming or required and it was apparently sent via regular mail, not certified or overnighted, and we never received it. That's 2 payments made. 

So they started us over again, new trial period, and we made 3 payments in XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. That's 5 trial period payments we made at that point. We received an email that we'd been approved for the HAMP modification and would be receiving paperwork that we would need to have notarized and sent back. No details as to what it was or any figures. Just an approval email. 

We received an overnight packet from XXXX  with the modification paperwork and figures. I called in to Wells Fargo after looking over the numbers, and I wanted a detailed itemization of the figures that they came up with to modify the loan. My foreclosure "" specialist '' could not answer these simple questions - even though all the numbers are there in their computer system. She got belligerent with me on the phone about how I "" better make the payment '', etc ... I sent several emails and left voicemails with ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE back. NO email responses from her, NO letters in the mail, NO return phone calls. 

I called and made another payment over the phone with someone else on XX/XX/XXXX ( after no explanations, no responses and no calls returned ), and then on XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a letter in the mail that they "" are no longer moving forward with the HAMP program '' for our account. 

A few days later, I receive a letter from their foreclosure attorney, and last Thursday, the sheriff posted the court documents on my front door that state our foreclosure hearing is set with the county on  XX/XX/XXXX. 

We qualified for, and were approved for, a HAMP loan modification. We did not however, know what was involved prior to the trial period payments - only what the payment itself would be. 

I am not happy with the modification numbers and did not sign the documents that were sent to me, instead I wanted to work with my mortgage company to see if there was an alternative, but they REFUSE TO RESPOND and now have us set for foreclosure. I feel my rights as a consumer have been violated by the mortgage company refusing to answer questions or explain their figures, which I believe are double-dipping, and possibly fraudulent or illegal.

Every letter the specialist ever sent clearly stated "" please call me if you have any questions ''. I had questions - she refused to answer them, and then refused to respond altogether. She removed us from the program instead. Even though we qualified for assistance. I just want to verify the numbers before signing - because they show that we will end up owing more than we started with after making three years ' worth of payments. And they were increasing our interest rate, not lowering it. They took a chunk of the principal balance and "" amount in deliquency '' ( the number they refused to explain how they arrived at it ) and are setting it out as a perpetual silent second mortgage that will never be paid down or paid off until we sell or refinance the property. At which time, WF will receive all of that money - double dipping when they get it. We were not given any other option as far as lower interest rate, extended term of the mortgage, nothing.

And now, thanks to WF XXXX us around, we're even further behind in the payments. This should have been handled in a timely manner and it was NOT. It's been over 90 days since I made the 3rd payment of the trial period, and I made an additional payment last month in XXXX after not hearing anything from them. Now that they've set a court hearing, they won't accept another payment from me, and that will cause more months to go behind. 

On top of that, this company receives millions of dollars in HAMP funds each year to help people struggling with their payments - there is no evidence in these numbers that ANY HAMP funds were being used to help us. I'm not asking for free money, but if the government intends those funds to be used to help people, and WF isn't using them to do just that, then WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH THOSE MILLIONS ( WILL BE BILLIONS BY XXXX WHEN IT ENDS ) OF DOLLARS IN HAMP FUNDS? Are they just eating that money? My trial payment letter clearly states we were in a HAMP loan modification. But every dollar is showing it's coming from us in the end, not HAMP funds at all. And now, the HAMP program is no longer accepting applications? 

I don't know where to turn at this point. But I believe this is an illegal foreclosure.

So I logged in and in order to read all of the pertinent information, I had to opt in two or three different companies to be able to contact me at any time. If I did not want to do this on the computer that way, at the bottom was a number to call and do it over the phone. I was not clear about a 2.9 % charge, so I called to make sure I had a better understanding. I called the first time and spoke with customer service to explain the charge. I was told 0 % for 12 Months and a 2.9 % charge for any additional purchases made on the account. I said ok thank you. I called the second time and asked the same question and was told 0 % for 12 Months and a 2.9 % charge for any additional purchases made on the card. I did the balance transfer on XX/XX/2019 and it posted on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$3700.00}. It was a 4 % Balance Transfer Fee of 4 % which in total is {$150.00}. On XX/XX/2019 I made a small payment of {$33.00} and my balance was {$3800.00}. On XX/XX/2019 around XXXX I noticed my balance changed to {$3900.00}. I checked online and it stated, "" Interest Charge on Purchases {$3.00}. '' I didn't make any purchases, So I immediately called WellsFargo to see what happened and was told because I did the balance transfer in the middle of the month. I stated, "" What difference does it make if the promotion was over XX/XX/2019. '' He kept putting me on hold and could not give me an answer. he put in a complaint and gave me a complaint number and stated that a Case Manager of some sort would call me back in a day. A day went by no call so I called them. Let 's just say I called six different times, I have two complaints filed with numbers. The people I was transferred to where very rude and not knowledgeable about anything that I was asking. According to WellsFargo all the calls are recorded. So the last person I spoke with by the name of XXXX stated that the Case Managers were out. I said well when will I receive a phone call back and he stated, I don't know their schedules and being very rude. He also stated the case manager was out sick and my case was assigned that day.

Approximately a year ago I requested that Capital One please freeze my accounts, stop all interest, and let me continue to pay on the principal balance. They would not agree to that. I also offered a {$12000.00} payoff v. the balance of approximately {$16000.00}, and they would not agree to that either. 

I was on a plan for lesser payments, but ultimately they kept requiring me to catch payments up, including late fees assessed for not making full payments, and of course interest. The amount of interest being charged monthly is more than the payments I was making. I tried to settle with them, but nothing has worked. I can not afford an attorney for bankruptcy at this time, and their payment requirements are now beyond reach. 

I was going to utilize another credit card for a no interest period, but my credit has been destroyed and my other card now has only {$1000.00} available, not the {$12000.00} I had available when this started with my trying to settle with them over the last year or more. 

I have now paid so much interest that I have more than likely paid at least half of what would have been the original balance. I would like to see if you can help in any way. I think Capital One should have let me pay on the principal balance and stopped any interest from accruing. 

According to our Constitution, interest is not legal, and maybe some day that can be enforced again, but I would ask at minimum that they reduce the balance due by removing all interest they have charged me, at least for the last year or so that I have been trying to work with them, and also late payment fees while I was making the lesser payments they agreed to.. 

They told me it would save my credit report if I made the lesser payments under their plan but obviously that has not been the case. 

I finally stopped making payments because, as I said, the interest continued to be more than any payment I would make. Since discovering MasterCard is also providing funds for the invasion of illegal immigrants into our country by providing them with prepaid debit cards, it is my feeling that they should release all debt and clear my credit report.

- Santander never showed on my account page how much interest is being accrued daily, weekly, or monthly and how much has been paid. 
- Neither Santander nor XXXX offered to replace my car with its defective instrument cluster for a different vehicle.

The bank can not reverse it at all. By law the checks take 2-3 days to clear. But on XX/XX/19 my account was in overdraft by that amount. My bank uncleared the check for no reason and without warning. I filed a complaint, tried to follow up with the bank, and the sender, and got no real answer. I have proof of the check clearing on XXXX in my statements, so I do not understand why this is happening to me. 

In a response from Wells Fargo they basically say nothing. Why did they clear the funds? And more importantly, once the check cleared it was my money and they can not confiscate this money without due process ( i.e., a court order ). Just saying the other bank asked for the money means nothing and it is my right to sue them for this. They are taking my money away without due course and I will be seeking legal remedy. 

Furthermore, I demand my money back. An explanation of what happened and why is not sufficient after this gross injustice. The whole point of having a bank account is knowing that my money is safe, not to wake up one day with an insufficient funds notice because one or more banks decided to unclear a check after three months. 

Additionally, on XX/XX/19 I was told by a customer service rep ( XXXX ) over the phone that the check would be returned to me because I hadn't endorsed it. I thought it was illegal to clear and unclear checks like this. They can not take away the money that belongs to me after funds are credited to my account- at that point that is my possession ). 

To conclude, Wells Fargo describing this happened does not clear the issue. They took my money away based on a no reason given issuer bank demand - that is ( at least to me ) a violation of Federal clearing laws - all check clearing related matters are governed by Regulation CC which prescribes the rules for this under the law : under Expeditious return of checks. ( which gives 2 business days to return a check ) and Notice of nonpayment ( which also asks for two days limit for such notice that notice can be via returned check, a writing ( including a copy of the check ), or telephone.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,NJ,089XX,451965,1767808000000,OCC,1479499000000,170894000000,Washington,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-25

( N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:50-1 through 2A:50-2.1. ) The court may limit the amount of the deficiency judgment if the borrower disputes it. The borrower may dispute the amount of the deficiency by answering the lenders suit and introducing evidence regarding the propertys fair market value. The court will then limit the deficiency judgment amount to the difference between the debt and the fair market value as of the date of the foreclosure sale. ( N.J. Stat.

3155814,2019-02-18,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Confusing or missing disclosures,NA,"I've used PayPal Credit over the past couple of years to make purchases on XXXX based on offers of no interest credit I was offered on multiple purchases. I've borrowed and paid back several thousand dollars. This past XXXX I was offered a "" 24 month with no interest and equal monthly payments '' promotion provided I spent over {$600.00} which I took advantage of. I made purchases totaling {$2200.00} and was told I would have 24 equal payments of {$92.00}. Subsequent to that purchase I also agreed to use PayPal Credit to purchase items using their "" 6 months with no interest if paid in full '' which, about the same time I made the 24 month purchase, they started saying there would be a "" minimum payment '' with these 6 month promotions. Previously, those promotions would be "" 6 months no interest and no payments '' if paid in full - which I always have done. While I wasn't sure how they would calculate the minimum payments on the 6 month items I assumed whatever payments I would make would apply to the balances of those items and reduce the amount I needed to pay them off during the sixth month time period. After I got notice of the first month with a minimum payment that exceeded the {$92.00} on the 24 month promotion I made a payment in excess of that minimum simply so I could calculate how they allocated the different amounts - meaning, how much would go to each purchase as there were multiple purchases on the 6 month promotions. I was stunned to see that they applied nearly the entire amount of the payment - {$450.00} - to the 24 month items. I first emailed them and got a "" canned '' response stating that the payment would be applied to the 24 month item and if I wanted to "" re-allocate '' the payment, I could do so after the next statement billing cycle. While I thought that strange ( and, when I looked back, not all of the {$450.00} payment was applied to the 24 month items, but instead about {$390.00}. I was never able to figure out, looking at the statement, how they planned to allocate the payment ) I then called and had the payment re-allocated with the intention the minimum on the 24 month items would be paid first and the rest would go toward the first items due, which was in early XXXX. This happened the next month as well and I ended up calling and having the payment re-allocated ( I thought ) with the first part of the payment being the {$92.00} on the 24 month promotion. Looking back on the statements, I'm still very confused as to how they're allocating the payments ( and, I get a different explanation each time I call ) - but, at that time, when I called I made an additional payment while I had the representative on the phone. He told me simply to call in each month and they could allocate the money exactly as I wished - with any payment over the {$92.00} being allocated to the 6 month items as I requested. This month, on XX/XX/XXXX I had a minimum payment of {$260.00} due, so I called in and made a payment of {$1000.00} which would make the minimum payment on the 24 month promotion ( the {$92.00} ) plus pay off all of what was due on XX/XX/XXXX. I was assured by the representative that would be what happened. When I checked back a couple days later almost the entire payment amount had been applied to the 24 month promotion. So, I started a chain of "" messages '' ( emails? ) via PayPal 's website requesting they allocate the payment as I had requested. After three or four messages the allocation was changed to the entire "" minimum payment '' - including whatever was required because of the purchases using the 6 month promotions - being applied to the 24 month promotion and then the rest going to the XXXX items - leaving a balance of a bit over {$160.00} on the XXXX items. I then called in an attempt to get all the money I had intended go to the XXXX items applied as I had agreed with the PayPal representative who I originally scheduled the payment with over the phone. After feeling as if the person I was talking to didn't understand what my intentions were I requested to talk to a manager who then told me their rules require them to apply ALL of the "" minimum payment '' to the items with recurring monthly payments - the items I AGREED to terms which said I would have 24 EQUAL monthly payments of {$92.00}. The manager stated that until I had paid off the 24 month promotion this is how the initial part of any payment would be allocated - therefore, essentially, changing the terms of the agreement. Obviously, PayPal feels the FACT they offered me a promotion which called for the 24 months of EQUAL payments of {$92.00} was not anything resembling a contract or firm agreement. By my calculations, depending on how long it takes me to pay off the items I purchased using their 6 month promotion ( the last ones are due to paid off by XX/XX/XXXX ) I might have paid an additional ( almost ) {$1000.00} over the agreed amount of the payments on the 24 month promotion. Additionally, after going through this with the manager I looked more closely at how PayPal has been allocating the payments thus far, and it's hard to understand what they're doing. I don't believe they are allocating the payments in any way according to what I've been told or even according to what the manager explained to me. I do believe my total amount owed is correct, but their statements are not clear as to how these payments are being distributed. Additionally, I find NOTHING on the statement which would tell me how they were going to allocate the payments - meaning their decision to apply ALL of the minimum to the 24 month promotions seems arbitrary and certainly was nothing I agreed to or would have agreed to. I've made the purchases and I will pay off all these items, but I really object to them forcing me to pay the additional money each month in order to be able to pay off the items I purchased on the six month deals. I believe it is an attempt to make it more likely I will end up paying interest on some of the items because, as I said, I'm going to have to come up with close to {$1000.00} more than budgeted to be able to pay off the six month items on time. And, then, I have no idea how PayPal plans to deal with what's left of the 24 month promotion payments, because, obviously, I will have paid much more than the agreed upon {$92.00} per month. This last month the excess I ended up paying over the {$92.00} was {$160.00}. I would say, I find this practice dishonest at best and likely fraudulent. Obviously, with PayPal 24 equal monthly payments isn't really that. The interest for anyone who doesn't pay off the items in the 6 months is close to 30 % and, I find it offensive that it appears PayPal is attempting to create situations where people are more likely going to end up paying this interest. Finally, after looking more closely at the statements, I find PayPal 's entire system confusing and, very possibly, arbitrary.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,WA,NA,1216022,85303000000,OCC,65849000000,10100000000,New York,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,-19

This letter was not sent to me directly via mail, despite the fact that I faxed and mailed my dispute letter. Instead it was added to my account notices, which I did not receive until XXXX when I went searching for resolution, having never heard back from Chase. I discovered that without speaking to me, Chase reopened and closed my second dispute in less than 5 business days, without making any efforts to contact me. 
I called Chase again on XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised initially that the dispute was closed. I asked to speak to a supervisor, XXXX. He first advised me that I could have no recourse since it had been "" so long since the original transaction. '' I informed XXXX that this transaction had been in dispute since XXXX so I did not understand why further action would be time barred. He then came back and told me a number of contradictory things. He stated that Visa denied my dispute because they had no evidence that I returned the merchandise. He then stated that returning the merchandise would not make a difference since the contract states that there are no refunds. He then said that I needed to show continuous efforts to resolve the matter with the merchant, even though the merchant had never communicated again with us. I was informed that I was required to make the right efforts to resolve the matter with the merchant now that Chase had denied my dispute. He could not tell me what would constitute right. He repeatedly advised, however that I actually had no recourse so I need not waste my time. I asked if I should return the merchandise and was told he could not or would not advise me to return the merchandise, despite this being the stated reason for denial of my dispute. I was told I should again reach out to the merchant and ask them to accept a return of the merchandise and then I can resubmit to reopen the dispute. I asked why I would be required to continue making futile efforts to communicate with the merchant, when the matter was being disputed by Chase and the merchant had not responded to my repeated inquiries. I also asked what was the point of me resubmitting the dispute if Chase would not bother communicating further with me. 
The experience with Chase has been frustrating and unhelpful. They have not communicated effectively with us and have provided contradictory information. They have also failed to specify exactly what it is we as the victimized consumer should to retain these funds. As noted to the Chase agent, we have done everything asked but they have been unhelpful and have failed to advocate on our behalf.

I filed a dispute with my Chase XXXX Visa. Chase gave a temp credit of {$680.00}. 
The merchant responded to the charge back and provided Chase Visa a XXXX tracking number. 
I fought with Chase because I knew we didn't receive the teeth, and yet I had no idea how to prove we hadn't received the teeth. 
I left chase alone & paid the {$680.00}.

Turns out the XXXX delivered to the wrong address ( which has happened before in my rural area ). I have went put of my way to make 2 deliveries of packages to houses on my street. 
When my bf opened the package they were not what we ordered at all. So I contacted my Chase XXXX Visa explained to them the complete situation and apologized for giving them a hard time previously, told them we got the merchandise but it wasnt at all what we ordered and they told me to send it back to XXXX ask for a refund and wait 12 to 15 days for the merchant to give us a refund, if after the 12 days had passed they would process a refund for my {$680.00} once I called them back and provide a XXXX number for our return.

I have opened an account by Wells Fargo, and I am very unhappy. Please see below for the issues that I am having with them : When I applied for a business secured credit card, I was told that it has an automatic system that will upgrade to a unsecured credit card after 6 months, by making a review on my account. I have my secured credit card for almost a year, and I was never upgraded. In the meantime I was approved for a other business credit card. When I was researching how there policy works I found on XXXX XXXX that almost no-one was upgraded from a secured to an unsecured credit card. I know that I have a good score, I was approved for several unsecured credit cards without any issues, and I pay my bills in time, therefore I cant see any reason why I shouldn't get my unsecured credit card by Wells Fargo. The only reason why I didn't get upgraded to an unsecured credit card is because this whole thing is a scam, it doesn't begin to be true. 

My wife by mistake made a purchase by XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I did not give permission, or even know about the purchase. XXXX XXXX XXXX does not have a return policy, so I went and disputed the charge by Wells Fargo, since I know that they are supposedly responsible for any charge that was done without any permission from the card holder, part of their policy is : "" I have zero liability protection= that you are not responsible for any unauthorized transaction when you report them promptly ''. After a month of going back and forth with them with no customer service at all, they sent me a letter that it was declined, since the merchant showed that I did not follow the merchant cancellation policy, and I received the tickets. Yes i did receive the tickets, but it was never used since we couldn't even get any use out of those tickets, because it was ordered in error. I called them again and they told me that the only thing they can do is that I need to fill out a letter for declaration of claimant for fraud, but this was a purchase made in error, and it was a miss understanding, so claiming a letter about fraud won't help me because this wasn't a fraudulent charge.

Wells Fargo continues to send unwanted XXXX notifications in delaying and distracting from answering the questions posed to this criminal company in their violations of federal regulatory law as well as criminal law concerning the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) and various other regulatory violations as well as criminal fraud and money laundering. They distract and delay answering these questions as it will expose their criminal activity and the activity of Wachovia Bank in 2007 when banks were making windfalls on refinance loans disregarding rules and regulations, competence in transactions by their employees, and fraud to the American consumer. By the shear volume of these refinances and the money that was made, these banks exposed themselves to their shoddy workmanship and to remedy blamed the customers for their mistakes. 

Questions were : 1 ) Why did Wells Fargo sue my person when their acquired bank made the mistake in not requiring a XXXX   balance HELOC not be closed prior to closing knowing the account existed as reported on the credit report and by customer that it existed. Customer paid {$380.00} for that credit report and is the responsibility of the lender to underwrite such disclosure? 2 ) Why did Wells Fargo not notify attorneys of borrower and defendant in their lawsuit against borrower that they dropped their frivolous lawsuit and sold the mortgage to XXXX XXXX as required by federal law? 

Wells Fargo is deliberately trying to confuse and deflect their liability, both civil and criminal, by delaying and reiterating their false narrative to the CFPB and the OCC.

3133610,2019-01-25,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Chase Bank notifying me that an unauthorized purchase with my Chase Credit Card was made at a XXXX XXXX Store ( # XXXX ) for the amount of {$1600.00} and {$2100.00} ( a total {$3800.00} ). Then and there I realized I have lost my Credit Card. 

I immediately denied making any purchase at any XXXX XXXX Store that day. I was later informed that Chase 's Fraud Department will investigate to determine the validity of the charges. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter informing me that, after a "" thorough '' investigation, Chase 's Fraud Department determined that the transactions were valid. Thereafter, I called and spoke with the representative who was in charge of investigating my case. I was informed that because my Credit Card has a chip, and that chip was used for the purchase, then necessarily I must have been the one to  make the purchase! 

Again, I told her I did not make the purchase. Someone who wrongfully took possession of my Credit Card used the card without my authorization, and in the process of said unauthorized use, he or she must have used the chip on the card to make the transactions. How that means that I must have been the one to make the purchases is completely without basis. 

I asked her whether or not she made any attempts to obtain the video surveillance at the XXXX XXXX store in question -- because certainly it will be unequivocal proof that the purchases were made by someone other than me. To which the representative responds that I am the one who is supposed to do so. 

Right after, I attempted to contact the XXXX XXXX store in question. I was told I needed to contact their corporate office 's fraud department, to which they transferred me to. The corporate office then told me that they can not release any videos without the order number of the purchases. Of course, I certainly don't have the order number -- I was not the one to make the purchase, and, therefore, I do not have the receipt or any information as to those purchases. In fact, it's clear that XXXX XXXX was in a better position to obtain the order number than I was -- after all, it's their store and they are the ones to keep records of transactions. 

It is clear Chase 's Fraud Department did not make the alleged "" thorough '' investigation. It would appear that all the representative did was make sure that the Credit Card chip was used to make the purchase. This entire dispute revolves around the fact that someone else has possession of my card. He or she will and has undoubtedly used the Credit Card chip to make the purchase. Just because the transactions were made with the Credit Card chip in no way represents that it was made by me, especially given the circumstances that I did not have possession of the Credit Card.

I reminded them of all the fraudulent activity WF was in the news for again, and that now they were stealing from me. He agreed to waive half of the fee and stated that was all the system would allow him to do. I told him that was unacceptable for them to steal any money from me under the guise of Overdraft Charges for a check that did not bounce.

I am upset that Synchrony Bank took extreme measures to ruin my credit, including not contacting me regarding the one late payment that I had on my account. 
Currently, my credit report is reflecting one 30-day delinquency for XX/XX/XXXX and one 60-day delinquency for XXXX of XXXX on this account. I am not disputing the late payment in itself, but I am very upset that Synchrony would not take the time to understand my circumstances and assist me with this matter. 
I opened a XXXX  XXXX  XXXX XXXX card in XX/XX/XXXX. I consistently made my minimum payments each month. In XX/XX/XXXX, Synchrony urged me to enroll in paperless billing and I did. I have consistently had both a monthly {$5.00} recurring charge and corresponding {$5.00} auto-draft payment take place on the account with minimal usage otherwise. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a {$33.00} purchase that I forgot I charged to my XXXX  XXXX account and did not increase my automatic payment to cover this purchase. Synchrony assessed multiple late payments which caused this {$33.00} purchase to grow into a {$140.00} balance. In XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my credit report and only then realized that this account was delinquent. 

Synchrony Bank has all my contact information on file ( address, phone, email ) but never contacted me regarding this past due balance.

Before I do any bill pay, I MAKE SURE that I have enough money from my checking account to cover the amount of check I am writing.

I opened an account at Chase on line later that day. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I went to a nearby branch to make the deposit. I double checked with a man I think was a manager to confirm they would accept the check and he confirmed they would so I made the deposit. The next morning I had an alert on my phone that my account was overdrawn by the amount of the check and my account was restricted and would be closed soon. I called Chase right away to see what happened. I was told that my wife would need to confirm that the check be deposited in my account ( we don't have a joint account ) and that they would not release the funds without her approval. I was told by the first few people I spoke to that if I could give them a US phone number issued in her name so they could call her to confirm. She is in XXXX and I'm not sure it is possible to get a prepaid SIM card I could send her, but the woman I spoke to at the CFPB said I should try. I have been working with a woman, XXXX, in Chase 's executive office to try to resolve this. Her number is XXXX ext. XXXX. It is urgent that I have access to this money as I am currently unemployed wait for SS XXXX, but at present I have no income, and rent is over due. I have been borrowing from family and friends and thought I would have the finds by now. I hope there is something you can do. I feel I have been robbed of this money. I was told they will hold it for 2-3 yeas and then release it to the state and I will be able to collect it as unclaimed funds. This doesn't seem acceptable. If their loss prevention department has decided not to release the funds to my account they should return them to me. XXXX is working on this, to get them to write me a new check, but she doesn't sound very confident when I speak with her. I hope you can help.

On XX/XX/XXXX I opened the app to see my score and was presented with a "" good offer '' on a credit card from Citi ( Citibank/Citicards ). The deal was, according to what I was presented with on the app, I could make up to 4 balance transfers on to the card up until XX/XX/XXXX. There would be 0 % interest on the transferred balances until XX/XX/XXXX. I applied for the card and was accepted with a balance limit of {$1100.00}. 

My first transfer was initially rejected because I went over the {$1100.00}. limit, not having factored the 3 % transfer fee. I spoke to a representative of Citi when it was rejected to find out why, and was told the above. She had said to me I could make more than 4 transfers, "" as many as I like '', as long as transferred by XX/XX/XXXX. I allowed for the fee and made my first transfer for the max allowed on XX/XX/XXXX. My plan was to pay that down quickly so that I could transfer more over to the card. I made a payment of {$400.00}. on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Citi so that I could make another balance transfer. The representative I spoke with, XXXX - ID # XXXX, told me that he was unable to make the transfer, that it had expired. Expired? I gave him the XXXX deadline and then he said I could only make one transfer. One transfer? He dug deeper and found the offer and said that it was unusual that it would be rescinded. He filed a complaint on it and told me to call back on XX/XX/XXXX. I called on the XXXX and was once again told the same thing, expired, only one transfer, to check periodically for new deals. Right. Nothing I said mattered. I talked to the next level up, I did not get his name, who said there was nothing he could do, that they had no control over a 3rd party offer ( XXXX XXXX ), and that "" the decision was made 3 or 4 levels up the chain. '' I asked who that would be, and he said the vice presidents and president of the company! 

My complaint is Citi rescinded their offer with no explanation, no nothing. I would of never taken the card on a one balance transfer with a low limit, in fact it negatively affected my credit rating. The offer provided to me on XXXX XXXX seemed like a good opportunity to get my credit paid down. I was happy about it. That offer was confirmed to me in a Confirmation Letter from Citi, dated XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached ). I view this as reckless, wanton, callous fraud.

In an effort to resolve the issue, I contacted Chase Bank via phone multiple times. The call center representatives came up with contradictory information every time. The details of my telephonic correspondence with chase is presented in an attached table. 

Finally, I traveled to New York on XX/XX/2018 to resolve this problem. I visited Chase Bank branch in the XXXX and personally met a banker on XX/XX/2018 to get a clearer picture. Even the banker in the branch was unable to help me and was astonished that they are unable to trace the original check. They suggested sending a copy of the check to the address of the party who wrote the check ( address was printed on the check ). I was informed that I shall have to wait 8-days for the check to be delivered to that address in NY. According to the banker, I must have received the copy of the check and updates about the problem much earlier. But even after the passage of around 3-weeks, the fate of this transaction in unknown. 

This ATM error and further mismanagement due to false and contradictory information presented by Chase Bank call centers has caused me a lot of mental and financial distress. I had to put my payments on hold resulting in accrued late payment fines from the creditors as well as loss of trust. It will also negatively impact my credit score. I had to travel to NY at the recommendation of the Chase Call Center representatives and the banker in the Chase Branch. And I am adding to my costs by staying in NY and waiting to receive updates from Chase. I request that either the check be returned to me promptly, or the amount be deposited in my account immediately. Further, I demand Chase Bank to compensate me for the financial and mental distress caused by their mishandling of the transaction as well as reimburse me for my stay in NY and travel between New York and XXXX.

Most credit card companies, upon being notified, have immediately canceled the card and refunded the fraudulent charges. 

Bank of America, on the other hand, has refused to cancel the charges, claiming since the card was physically present, I am responsible. 

My Bank of America credit card had never been used in the previous 5 years, and yet, upon being used for a number of charges, no fraud alert or notification was sent to me. I personally noticed the charges when I was billed, and immediately notified Bank of America. 

During Bank of America 's investigation they noticed there was another phone number on my account, but they could not identify where that phone number came from. Was it used to activate the stolen card, or did someone else have access to my account? The only thing they claimed was since the card was physically present ( obviously, since it was stolen ), I was liable for those charges, which was a total of {$53.00}. 

As far as I can tell, Bank of America is unable to adequately protect its clients accounts and also unable to adequately investigate fraudulent charges. I have since closed my account, but am looking to get those fraudulent charges dismissed.

XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXX., charge of {$86.00} with my XXXX XXXX at a Restaurant XXXX XXXX XXXX, Washington D.C. 

2. My cycle ends day 4 of every month. Upon receiving my monthly statement in XXXX, I noticed that this charge changed to exactly twice the amount : {$170.00}. I disputed the amount online. 

3. On XX/XX/XXXX I was given a PERMANENT credit for {$86.00}. Citi case # XXXX. 

3. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received in the regular mail a letter from Citi, Dispute Department, signed by XXXX XXXX, Service Specialist, Phone XXXX, email : XXXX asking for supporting information of my dispute, and saying : "" ... if we don't hear from you by XX/XX/XXXX ( 2 days upon receiving this letter ), we'll investigate with the information we have available, and the conditional credit may be reversed ''. 

4. Same date ( this was in the evening after I got home from my office ) I called customer services, explained the situation and expressed surprise for the letter and time frame given to answer the letter and provide supporting documents, considering that I already received an email confirming the permanent resolution of the dispute, and the information online, in the dispute center, indicated that the dispute has been permanently resolved. The customer service person agrees with me, that he was also looking at the same information on his screen. Nevertheless, he transferred my call to the dispute center. 

5. XXXX XXXX was not available, but the person who answered the phone said that it was strange that I got an email, that they ONLY inform about dispute resolution by regular mail. She dismissed my observation about the two days given in the letter to provide information, and said that I could scan my receipt and sent it to the email above, as well as a scanned copy of the form. I play along, and I did so, sending an email the same night at XXXX XXXX 

6. The following day, I called the restaurant, explain the situation, and they apologizes for the mistake. They offered to give me the credit on the spot, but I explained that I had already a conditional credit from citi, and to avoid confusions, it would be better to follow their process. They agree and stated that as soon as they receive the phone call from citi, they would confirm that there was an error. 

7. On XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXX, I receive an email from Citi ( reminder, the dispute center said they do not communicate by email the resolution of a dispute ( sic ) ), indicating that my dispute has been resolved. Happily, I signed on my account online ( as I did when in XX/XX/XXXX they already told me that the dispute was permanently resolved in my favor ), and to my surprise, I found an electronic letter saying that : "" after reviewing the dispute and the information you provided, we're unable to resolve the dispute in you favor ... ''. I was really surprised, considering that I send them a copy of my receipt that I signed in the restaurant, and the fact that the restaurant already agrees on the mistake ( you can not refute a hard copy proof ). 

8. I immediately called customer services and explained the situation, and asked for the right instance to file a formal complaint and a resolution of the problem. The person on the phone was also surprised. He gave me a PO Box for the "" Office of the President '', for XXXX in South Dakota. He also offered me a {$100.00} credit for being a "" loyal customer '' ( I have a Citi AA Visa card since XXXX, which was arbitrary changed to a MC in XXXX ). I told him that I was grateful for that, but this was an issue of principles. There is a mistake and citi has to fixed and acknowledge it in writing. 

9. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I called the restaurant again. They were surprised by the action taken by Citi, they said that Citi NEVER called them. XXXX, in charge of accounting, gave me on the spot a credit for the amount. She entered the transaction manually in the system, and she was kind enough to send me a scanned copy of the receipts. That transaction was recognized in the system only on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

10. I have copy of all documents, receipts, emails, etc., described above. After doing some research in the internet, I realized that there are many similar complaints, handled by the "" Office oft the President '',  without much success. But at the same time, I "" discover '' the existence of your office, and I decided to send my complaint to you instead. It is very difficult for Citi to be a fair judge of what has happened, and a third neutral party is better suited to clarify this issue, and avoid future occurrences to other consumers, by "" encouraging '' Citi to improve their internal coordination, particularly in such a critical unit as the Dispute Center. 

I believe, because of negligence and wrong doing from Citi despite the evidence provided as requested, some action is needed. In the best case scenario, this is not a systemic behavior, but a problem with the staff managing disputes, which is also bad, and should be of public interest to avoid repetition of this behavior with other customers.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase via XXXX for an item for which I opted for XXXX 's "" 12 Easy Payments '' offer totalling {$2400.00}. As a result, this XXXX "" Credit '' was rolled into a Paypal Credit account, ( I had no Credit account with Paypal prior to this XXXX purchase ). From the beginning, this arrangement has been riddled with misinformation and lack of transparency. I first contacted Paypal Credit after reviewing my first Paypal Credit statement on XX/XX/XXXX indicating that my XXXX purchase was being charged interest from the moment I made the purchase of XX/XX/XXXX ( {$5.00} incurred during the 5 day statement period ). This is not what I had believed my terms to have been, so I attempted to contact Paypal Credit regarding my concerns. Initially, I was redirected by a representative to XXXX for more information regarding terms ( because, I was told, this was something that Paypal Credit only administered and had no other info ) before being bounced back to Paypal Credit and a new representative who informed that, yes, Paypal is in fact the administrator to contact on this item. It was at this point in time that I was made aware of the interest calculation being applied to my account ( accrued daily from the time of purchase ). Eager to get this item paid off due to the terms that I did not feel comfortable with, I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX to clear off as much of the balance as possible. I was told that there was nothing Paypal could do and that I had consented to the terms as outlined. Up until this point, I can say with sincerity that while I was a bit surprised by the reliance on fine print to explain what I had initially thought was a simple purchase and promo offer, I would not characterize my interaction with Paypal as negligent. However, every interaction following my next call with a Paypal Credit representative the following week on XX/XX/XXXX I would now characterize as negligent. It was on this call on XX/XX/XXXX, now made aware of the interest terms that apply to my XX/XX/XXXX charge, that I explicitly requested a dollar figure from the support rep that would close out this balance and obligation. I was informed by the rep of that amount total ( {$470.00} ), and authorized that payment over the phone. Since that date, I have since received my newest statement dated XX/XX/XXXX with the line item still listed and a partial balance remaining on the item in question. After talking with one representative on XX/XX/XXXX, who was totally unaware of the terms as they apply for a 3rd party offer such as mine, I was misinformed that I was not being charged interest on my item and told that I misunderstood the terms. I knew this to be incorrect ( I had already paid a total amount to Paypal beyond the purchase amount, so this was indisputable ), so I requested that I be transferred to someone more knowledgeable of this transaction type. After explaining the situation to the Supervisor,  I was informed that the payment made with a service rep over the phone on XX/XX/XXXX was not applied in a way that would fully cover the total balance due. I informed the supervisor that I explicitly requested that that be done, and that the rep unequivocally confirmed that to be the case. I asked whether the interest incurred since that payment could be waived given the clear error. She said it could not be waived. I then asked how could I confirm that any new payment I were to make would be properly allotted so that the balance would clear. She informed me that Paypal Credit is unable to provide any documentation that confirms this action, and that as the supervisor that this would be done correctly. I informed her that I would be contacting any and all consumer protection bureaus regarding what I considered to be negligent behavior and mishandling of my account ( by providing me with incorrect or misinformed information in nearly every interaction I've had with Paypal Credit since the account was setup ) that has cost me interest incurred with no acknowledgement of error.

When I return to the U.S. I received a mailed letter from Bank of America that my 2 ( a business and personal credit card ) credit card accounts were closed. I was shocked and didn't understand why. Before leaving for my business trip, I made sure both accounts had a zero balance and was in good standing. I called Bank of America the next day after arriving back in the U.S. and was not given any specific reasons as to why the credit card accounts were closed. I also stopped into a local branch to see if there was any additional information on why the accounts were closed and they were not helpful either. My personal XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card miles for.. 

Here are reasons why I believe my accounts should be reactivated/unfrozen : 1 ) Investments - I have money to invest and currently have my money at other competing financial firms in a couple of separate wealth management accounts. I have a good friend that retired from XXXX XXXX in the and we have spoke about investing some of my money with Bank of America/XXXX XXXX. Before leaving for my business trip overseas, I inquired about a private client relationship with XXXX XXXX. 

2 ) Rewards - I believe that Bank of America has not sent XXXX   XXXX XXXX earned through spend on my business card ( ending in XXXX ) to XXXX XXXX on my most recent statement during which my account was closed. I believe those miles add up to somewhere between 5,000 to 30,000 miles. Bank of America did send miles to my personal card but has not done so with my Business ( XXXX ) card. 

3 ) History - I have been a XXXX customer for the past 5 years or so with a great history of on time payments and my accounts have all been in good standing. 

4 ) Business spending - I have formally registered business registered with the state of Minnesota, with a federal tax ID number. All of the ( large ) spending on my Bank of America credit cards is directly connected to my business. I do value rewards, especially when I need to travel overseas for work, and the cards help me to earn rewards. I have significant business travel planned in XXXX and XXXX and would like to continue and further my banking relationships with Bank of America. 

5 ) Annual Fees - I had planned to renew both of my ( 2 ) Bank of America credit cards for the foreseeable future. I value my relationship with Bank of America for various reasons. I plan to continue my relationship and hopefully expand it in the future, but this closure/freeze is frustrating and confusing. 

6 ) Legal & Social Media - I haven't written, blogged, posted on XXXX, XXXX, or used other media outlets to publicize this situation, for which I believe that I've been misjudged for some unknown reason. I have spoken with a local attorney who has handled similar issues and related cases, but hope those rather negative options are avoidable. 

7 ) Credit - my credit score is around 770 and has been managed well for years. My credit and banking relationships are extremely important to me.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened this Care Credit account for the support and XXXX  care of the many rescued ( abused )  companion animals that reside ( for life ) in my home. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, an adjunct card - XXXX  - was added for the sole purpose of a one-time purchase of prescription eyeglasses by XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was added as an authorized user for that expressed purpose at that time ... to the best of our collective recollection. 

Despite being paid off in a relatively short time, the account lay dormant for several years, until - at my behest - it was closed for non-use on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX and I are divorced, and are amicably seeking to separate our finances : To that end, we have repeatedly asked Synchrony Bank to remove her from any and all liability for the remaining {$3700.00} balance ( out of a {$4500.00} limit ). 

They have stubbornly refused to provide proof that both of our names were added as account holders at the time the initial application that created this account was filed. 

It is our recollection and contention that she is merely an "" authorized user '' who did NOT participate in the original application ( as required by law ) and should therefore NOT be liable for the remaining balance, and should indeed have her authorization revoked ( at our request ) and her name removed from the account ( and subsequently, have this account removed from her credit reports ). 

Despite numerous online and email messages being sent, the sole paper correspondence received that actually addressed this issue ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) completely ignored our request - and provided no contact information by which to reach the originator ( no phone, nor email address ), other than a post office box to which written correspondence might be directed. 

Completely useless and meant to delay actually addressing our specific request. 

Per Synchrony 's directions, XXXX had sent a letter on XX/XX/XXXX, requesting the actions specified above. 

Having received an inappropriate response - which failed to address our simple request - dated XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ) ... followed on XX/XX/XXXX, by yet another utterly irrelevant document ( also attached ) ... online correspondence from myself which had commenced on XX/XX/XXXX continued through XX/XX/XXXX ... accompanied by numerous, lengthy telephone calls amplifying our repeated requests. 

Despite clear, unambiguous, specific requests for the original account application, Synchrony Bank has refused to address that request and provide proof that both of us requested and signed the initial application that this account was approved and authorized by. 

Interestingly - and disturbingly - during these many weeks, "" remarks '' were added and removed from our credit bureau reports ... remarks that we were unable to actually see, but that had decidedly negative impact on our credit scores - lowering each by several points.

I contacted the maker of the check, who stated that they did not request a Stop Payment Order. OlI escalated this issue to Executive Customer Service at Wells Fargo XX/XX/XXXX, and made them aware that the maker of the check did not request a Stop Payment Order - and confirmed this by allowing me to conference in with his Branch Manager at XXXX XXXX. The Branch Manager for XXXX XXXX wanted to know why Wells Fargo ( my bank ) was requesting a Proof of Funds Letter from the bank regarding the maker, and agreed to a telephone conference involving Wells Fargo and myself. During the conversation, Wells Fargo requested the Proof of Funds Letter from XXXX XXXX, and the Branch Manager refused - citing Client/Account Holder Privacy. When the Branch Manager asked why Wells Fargo needed this letter - Wells Fargo cited "" internal policy ''. The conference call ended with neither bank cooperating with the other - and no resolution to the issue which was not created by me. As a result of this situation, my account balance at Wells Fargo went from having a positive balance to now being negative - {$1200.00} and increasing, due to debit purchases that were made over the weekend of XX/XX/XXXX being returned - and future ACH debits posting into my account on XX/XX/XXXX In addition - Wells Fargo is charging me overdraft fees of {$35.00} for each transaction that they returned from the weekend of XX/XX/XXXX, due to the situation that they created. I don't know of any other bank that makes the full amount of a check deposit made available within 24hrs - then takes the available amount away ( 2 ) business days later for what they say are "" internal policies ''. I'm also concerned about the lack of cooperation between banks on transactions that take place between each other on behalf of their account holders. I need the CFPB 's assistance in getting this issue resolved immediately. I want the check deposit of {$2100.00} approved immediately, and all overdraft charges reversed - as I have previously signed up for a version of Overdraft Protection that Wells Fargo offers. This particular issue has been ongoing since XX/XX/XXXX ', as this is a check that I receive from the maker on a monthly basis. - However, this is the first time where they've allowed the deposit to go through within 24hrs - then take it away due to an issue like this.

( escalation unit ) ( 2 ) PREDATORY LENDING with us by switching our CONVENTIONAL loan to INTEREST only loan after 9 years of living in our home with our children without our knowledge but by FALSIFYING my signature during request for 4 months loan modification ( short term hardship assistance ) into INTEREST ONLY WITHOUT OUR CONSCENT OR KNOWLEDGE THROUGH FALSIFIED SIGNATURE. We have lived here for 18 years.

( 3 ) UNFAIR LENDING PRACTICES that have diminished our personal credit standing ( 4 ) VIOLATION OF CONSUMER PROTETION STATUES AND REGULATIONS ( 5 ) Wells Fargo sold  my home in XXXX through the practice of dual tracking. We sued wells Fargo, they agreed to settlement to reinstate our loan with some "" MANDATORY ARBITRATION '' But wells fargo did not fully reinstate my loan as settlement stated with the continuation of my original mortgage payment instead they inflated my monthly payment times 3. 
We have requested DETAILED HISTORY OF OUR PAYMENT ACTIVITIES SINCE OUR LOAN ORIGINATION DATE XXXX but Wells fargo only provided payment history from the year XXXX instead of the year XXXX to date. We have also requested our original loan amortization from the year XXXX but wells fargo has refused to provide that information. 


We asked for explanation of how our mortgage payment went from barely $ 2000+ to {$5800.00} a month, no one has given us an answer. We have complete documentations of evidence of dual tracking that we can forward directly to cfpb for review and audits We need answers to all these inquiries above and below. we also need wells fargo time to the same time that we gave them to review all documents and correspond with them before closing this case. 1 ) Dual Tracking : In XX/XX/XXXX, Wellsfargo was processing our loan modification without removing our property foreclosure. Agent were telling us documents to fax in which we did but foreclosure sale date was not moved or stopped. As foreclosure sale date was set, I was quoted {$120000.00} to reinstate the loan, take care of escrow balance ; attorney fees and all other delinquency fees. Provided Wells Fargo proof of funds from the bank to extend sale date or remove sale date but Wells Fargo proceeded to sell my property on XX/XX/XXXX, after speaking to my bank manager who confirmed availabity of funds. 2 ) We retained an attorney who sued Wells Fargo but Wells Fargo reached an agreement that if we should agree to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice, Wells Fargo will reinstate the loan as it was and credit all payments, past due escrow balance, taxes and insurance to bring account current with no extra charges. A payment of {$130000.00} as settlement amount. 3 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo signed the settlement agreement upon the receipt of {$130000.00} in lieu of rescind the sale, reinstate the loan to current status, take care of escrow account and resume account activities. 4 ) Wells fargo did not keep up their side of the deal because the payment of {$130000.00} was not properly credited to the account to take care past due escrow, payments, taxes, and insurance as was listed in the the detailed statement that was sent to us in XX/XX/XXXX regarding why {$130000.00}. 5 ) Wells Fargo did not reinstate the loan as it was where Wells Fargo pays our taxes and insurance as we had requested and how it was prior to settlement of lawsuit but instead Wells Fargo added forced escrow to our loan and did not provide detailed account of how and our payment of {$130000.00} was disbursed. This caused them to do wrongful escrow analysis on our loan thereby tripling our mortgage payments and making it unable for us to make our payments. 6 ) Wells Fargo also falsified interest only modification which we never requested and stated that our loan was an interest only loan when statements that was provided by Wells Fargo attorneys during lawsuit settlement in XXXX clearly showed our property as ARM and not interest only. 7 ) Our original loan was taking out in the year XXXX in the amount of {$240000.00}. As of today, Wells Fargo has turned our lives to a nightmare with the falsified interest only modification which puts our payoff amount to {$350000.00}, our monthly payment form {$1200.00} to {$5600.00}.

After ( 1 ) month of making ( 4 ) weekly payments, I received another charge from XXXX XXXX of {$190.00} that was charged on my BOA credit card again. 

- I reached out to XXXX XXXX via email - who told me that the {$190.00} was charged because I failed to cancel the service before ( 30 ) days. I explained to XXXX XXXX that I assumed that I was purchasing an individual product and not a subscription service ( as the company offers both of these, but the individual product does not expire and the subscription service does ). The company sent me back a lengthy and clear listing of their terms and conditions, which clearly showed me that the product that I purchased was a subscription service, and if I did not cancel within ( 30 ) days a monthly charge of {$190.00} would apply. 

- However, these clear and concise terms that XXXX XXXX provided me, was very inconspicuous on the email ads that was used to entice me to purchase the service. Specifically, XXXX XXXX used a browsewrap having only a hyperlink disclaimer that was located way below the ordering link, in which there was no reason for me to continue to scroll down to see it. Legally, this type of unreasonably difficult to locate terms and conditions is not valid, binding, nor can it be enforced. 

- On XX/XX/2018 I disputed the charges with BOA ( 4 ) {$140.00} charges as the service was not even working while I attempted to use it and overall I was completely dissatisfied with the service because it was not what was offered to me and I also disputed the {$190.00} charge as this was not even authorized. These charges were reversed and was I provided a credit by BOA, I received a letter from BOA days letter explaining that the dispute was under investigation, and I may need to provide evidence if the merchant disagreed. Shortly after, the charges were applied back to my account.

- However, BOA failed to send me a written explanation as described by the fair credit billing act. I only became aware of this by calling to make a payment on my account which was much longer than the 10 days that the investigation was convened.

( Chase Auto ) has reported account delinquencies for a closed auto lease account without notifying me of any amount being owed and they have continued to refuse to provide an invoice or statement to me for the amount supposedly owed. The credit bureaus have since downgraded my credit rating and the delinquency is published on my credit reports. 

Description of dispute : I entered into a 36-month vehicle lease with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as assignee ) on XX/XX/XXXX. I made all 36 monthly payments associated with this account in-full, returned the leased vehicle on-time, and I have never received notice of an additional amount being owed via mail, electronic mail, or otherwise. My account with Chase closed the day that I returned the leased car and I have not received a statement since I returned the car to the XXXX dealership. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the day before I was due to leave on my honeymoon, I received a notification from my XXXX  credit monitoring service that Chase had reported a past-due balance of {$1600.00} on my Chase account and that the account was at least 30 days delinquent. I had no knowledge of what this {$1600.00} debt consists of. As a direct result of these negative reports to the credit bureaus, my credit score was lowered by 106 points. 

When I discovered the negative reports, I immediately submitted a dispute to XXXX, but Chase only confirmed to XXXX the existence of the debt, which does not resolve the issue. A review of the online portal for the closed Chase account on XX/XX/XXXX revealed no current statements. 

I notified Chase by letter on XX/XX/XXXX that a delinquency was reported to the credit bureaus for a debt that I have never received a bill for and I requested a statement of the amount owed. I received a letter response from Chase on XX/XX/XXXX wherein they only stated that they reported an outstanding debt. I replied to that letter on XX/XX/XXXX to inform them that they have misinterpreted the issue and gave them 30 days to resolve the issue, but I received the same form letter in response on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received a collection call from Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, wherein the caller, XXXX, stated that they had sent a bill to the incorrect address. During the term of my lease, I moved to a new address and notified Chase of this move by updating my contact information in my Chase Bank online account more than two years before the termination of the lease.

3189440,2019-03-25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I am concerned that my mortgage servicing company, Wells Fargo, recently ( XX/XX/XXXX ) hired a real estate appraiser who provided a ridiculously low home valuation, thereby enabling Wells Fargo to keep PMI on the mortgage. The PMI costs us about {$100.00} per month. I also had to pay Wells Fargo {$100.00} to get this Broker Price Opinion ( BPO ). The house was purchased in XX/XX/XXXX for $ XXXX ( after having initially been listed for $ XXXX ( $ XXXX/sq.ft. ) during the height of the real estate boom ). 

The BPO only had to get our home value to $ XXXX ( $ XXXX/sq.ft. ) to remove PMI. XXXX suggests the home is now worth $ XXXX. XXXX   suggests the home is now worth $ XXXX. XXXX suggests the home is now worth $ XXXX. However, amazingly, the BPO concluded the house 's present value was only $ XXXX ( $ XXXX/sq.ft. ), thereby preventing removal of PMI. The BPO acknowledged the existence of $ XXXX of added-value improvements since purchase, but apparently the broker did not feel those improvements added any actual value to the home. The BPO suggested a power washing of {$800.00}, and found nothing else deficient with the house. 

By contrast, in XX/XX/XXXX the house across the street from us sold for $ XXXX/sq.ft., in XX/XX/XXXX the house two doors down from us sold for $ XXXXsq.ft. In XX/XX/XXXX, a house around the corner sold for $ XXXX/sq.ft. In XX/XX/XXXX, an older, significantly smaller house three doors up from us sold for $ XXXX/sq.ft. ( These figures are all verifiable at XXXX ). Disappointingly, none of these sales were considered in the broker 's BPO. The broker found it preferable to compare us to homes miles away instead. We only needed to get to $ XXXX/sq.ft. to remove PMI, and it baffles us how the broker could not reach that figure given the average actual price for square foot in our immediate neighborhood.

According to the agent spoken over the phone to on XXXX, 2 separate checks were to be issued, one in the amount of {$8000.00} [ Savings ], another for {$61.00} [ Checking ]. A representative in charge of closing the account contacted me on XXXX and stated the accounts were officially closed and two checks were processed and sent out on said date. They implied that it would take from 5-10 business days to receive the checks.

I called an agent to resolve the issue, they did notice the city was incorrect and stated that nothing could be done at the moment since the checks were sent out.

( XX/XX/XXXX ). Account kept in good standing with no late payments. Capital One acquired all of these accounts so everything migrated from XXXX  XXXX XXXX to Capital One. 

1st billing cycle with Capital One ran from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. Previous new balance was {$3400.00} and payments/credits were {$3500.00} ( more than prior carry over balance ). There were NO carry over interest charges or fees. Charges totaled {$6000.00} leaving a New Balance forward of {$5900.00} to START the 2nd billing  cycle. 

2nd billing cycle ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) with Previous balance the same as balance forward from 1st billing cycle XXXX {$5900.00} XXXX. During this billing cycle payments/credits equaled {$4100.00} which was less than the previous carry over balance so I fully expected to incur interest charges. These totaled {$52.00} and posted to my card on XX/XX/XXXX. Charges this cycle equaled {$2600.00} leaving my NEW BALANCE FORWARD of {$4500.00}. This balance forward was effective XX/XX/XXXX. 

3rd billing cycle XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX with a starting balance forward of {$4500.00}. THIS CYCLE I HAD PAYMENTS/CREDITS OF {$7000.00} which was {$2400.00} MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS BALANCE FORWARD. I was charged {$45.00} in interest charges on XX/XX/XXXX even though I had paid the previous statement new balance and {$2400.00} over and above the previous balance. Charges for this period were {$3600.00} to leave a NEW BALANCE FORWARD of {$1100.00}. 

The entire time the XXXX  XXXX XXXX card was in effect, as long as at least the balance forward from the previous statement was paid in full, new purchases had the benefit of the new purchase grace period. The above scenario NEVER OCCURRED with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I called Capital One thinking it was an error on their end since I had paid the entire previous months balance plus almost {$2500.00} to offset the current months charges. CSR advised that that if the grace period is not meet for one month, even if you pay the balance the next month, they still calculate interest on new purchases. This is not ethical or fair. In fact it is predatory. I requested to speak to a supervisor. I was given the same scripted explanation which besides being unfair and predatory, it also just does not make sense in any way other than a way for them to extort additional interest while ignoring the fact that in the course of making payments the previous months balance was satisfied in full. I then requested for the interest to be waived. The supervisor told me she looked and said I "" did not qualify for an interest waiver ''. I asked her why and she said "" you just didn't qualify ''. Having never been in default, been a long term customer, have NEVER had any fees waived in the past and with the amount I use this card for ( $ XXXX+ annually ) I would think I would be a preferred customer but that is their "" policy ''. 

I think there has to be some sort of law or statute that protects consumers from this type of misleading and predatory application of payments. Capital One is intentionally applying payments in a way to take advantage of consumers to extort additional interest when in reality the previous balance was actually paid in full meaning new purchases should NOT be subject to interest charges because the new purchases are not being given the agreed upon grace period for new purchases that is part of credit card terms of agreement. 

Also in regard to application of payments, apparently purchases made at XXXX XXXX   stores with this card receive a promotional interest rate. I was not aware of this. On the FIRST BILLING CYCLE there were total charges for this promotional rate of {$680.00}. Over the next 2 cycles I made payments totaling {$11000.00}. Capital One intentionally applied payments to this PROMOTIONAL BALANCE so that it only dropped to {$590.00} & {$550.00} respectively to charge interest of {$4.00} & {$4.00}!!! 

I can understand the interest charges that were applied for the FIRST month where I did not pay the previous statement NEW balance in full, but after that, I feel that I should have no interest charges at all and further over 2 months, paying {$11000.00}, the promotional balance should have been XXXX out rather than misapplying payments in order to maximize carry over balances to charge more interest.

Florida law is clear that negotiable instrument is an unconditional promise to or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order. 673.1041 ( 1 ), XXXX XXXX. ( XX/XX/XXXX). Our Line of Credit with Bank of America reflects no such undertaking. it only obligates us to repay whatever we borrow. As a result is not a negotiable instrument. We suggest that Bak of America reviews the must correct case law regarding the matter. See XXXX XXXX XXXX v XXXX XXXX XXXX, Case no. XXXX, attached herein. In XXXX v XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), the borrowers executed a series of credit agreements, the first for a credit line up to {$30000.00}, the second modified line of credit up to XXXX. The Florida Fifth DCA held that the line of credit was nonnegotiable instrument because it was not for a fixed sum. The bank of America line of credit note is not a self authenticated negotiable instrument. By its own terms, the note established a credit limit from which we could request in advance. The line of credit was not an unconditional promise to pay a fixed amount of money. Rather, it established the maximum amount of borrowing power extended to a borrower by a given lender, to be drawn upon by the borrower as needed. See Line of Credit Balcks Law Dictionary, 949 ( 8th ed. 1999 ). The BOA line of credit does not require the payment of a fixed amount of money, making it nonnegotiable instrument. As such, it is not self-authenticating. Absent proof of authentication, it was inadmissible. See XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.v XXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX) ( unauthenticated documents attach as an exhibit is inadmissible ). 

Bank of America may argue that the final judgment was acquired by consent. Although this may be true, under Florida law a homeowner may be relieve from consent to judgment on the grounds of mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect. A consent to judgment may be attacked under FRCPR XXXX ( B ). XXXX of XXXX XXXX v XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 10 Fla. L. Weekly XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX., XXXX ). At this juncture we are filling a XXXX ( b ) motion to be relieve from the final Judgment for the reasons stated.

Although we have sent multiple complete application followed by many emails and follow up phones the servicer would deny receiving any information, which the oldest trick in the world.

Shortly after, we received emails from their legal counsel claiming not to have received the documents and therefore only cash for keys is the options. The CFPB should know that XXXX and BOA have both engaged in elaborate scheme to defraud many homeowners.

These checks are always in same amount of {$110.00} and the maker is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I usually have deposited them once or twice a month for several years. 
However, this is absolutely the First time that Bank of America has taken such a stringent position and placed a ten ( 10 ) day hold on one of these checks and it was not released until XXXX. The only "" inconsistent response '' that the bank told me is that they had a "" suspicion '' that the check may be returned for Non-Sufficient Funds. This has Never happened, and 10 business days is an  exceptionally long time to place a hold on a check of {$110.00}. 
This hold caused so much chaos to my account. I was transferring money from another account. I took out a "" Pay Day Loan '' to avoid the "" Massive Amount of Fees '' that were still accessed and "" unfairly '' deducted from my account. 
XXXX = {$35.00} NSF and XXXX = {$35.00} Overdraft. [ Only One Example ] Although my other monthly electronic check was deposited on XXXX my checking account NEVER recovered from XXXX as a result of Bank of America charged me an "" excessively burdensome total of {$630.00} in "" unfairly assessed fees from XXXX thru XXXX. As a result, my checking account for XX/XX/XXXXwas already in arrears of $ XXXX as of today, XXXX, I only have {$69.00}.

Then the following day, XXXX these same transactions were deducted again - XXXX XXXX : {$9.00} ; XXXX XXXX : {$2.00} ; and XXXX XXXX : {$77.00}.

I finally called the number back yesterday after being extremely frustrated with the notifications going off on my phone for the blocked calls and no messages being left. I have also begun to receive calls from pinger numbers within 2 minutes of receiving a call from Synchrony. This is absolute harrassment. They cannot robocall my cell phone in an attempt to collect a debt, cannot call prior to XXXX, and they cannot call my phone that many times a day and not identify themselves. If they are using the pinger numbers that increases the level of harassment.

It was very unethical in the approach and discriminating tactic utilized by Wells Fargo in this case because they were well aware of the circumstance surrounding the claim when I initially reached out to them in XX/XX/XXXX. When I first spoke to a representative in on XX/XX/XXXX, they stated they did not need further other information regarding the claim after taking it over a call. We then later received a letter in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX, stating Wells Fargo was going to reverse the temporary credit because they had not received the requested information regarding the claim. What requested information? You never stated during our call on XX/XX/XXXX that I needed to send in any additional information based on the dispute call submitted. Also, I checked my Wells Fargo portal to login to see if I had previously received any email alerts regarding requested information, since the first claim was submitted and confirmed I had not received any communication in my portal since XX/XX/XXXX regarding this matter. Therefore, the letter we received in the mail XX/XX/XXXX, was the 1st contact we received from Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive an Voicemail from Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX. Also, if they were really making an attempt to request additional information on XX/XX/XXXX, why did they not send an email on the secured Wells Fargo Portal where all the Disputes are filed and posted with updates. We also agreed to be notified via email at the onset of the claim being submitted as well. Also, when we initially received the first and only letter in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX, I immediately reached out to Wells Fargo to inform them I had not received any communication from them that stated or suggested they were attempting to contact me regarding Claim XXXX for {$1700.00} and only during this phone call was I provided what I needed to do at this point. On the following day, XX/XX/XXXX, an email and corresponding attachments which are included in this claim were sent to Wells Fargo including text messages exchanged between myself and the mechanic regarding the defaulted and fraudulent service provided to my vehicle regarding a supposedly fixed transmission which was not repaired. From this point, we did not receive any further communication until XX/XX/XXXX, stating they would be reversing the {$1700.00} credit, utilizing an excuse stating that you authorized the transaction. Regardless, if you authorized the transaction, it was still completed under false prentenses from the XXXX XXXX XXXX, as they did not repair the vehicle appropriately and we provided this proof of information and documentation to Wells Fargo on several occasions and the credit of {$1700.00} should have remained on our account versus causing an overbearing hardship and burden to XXXX XXXX American Consumers due to greed and lack of care exhibited by Wells Fargo to ensure their customer remained unharmed. They would rather have the consumer take the loss in the interim versus pursuing the monies after receiveing the required proof regarding this fraudulent transaction. Therefore, we are requesting that our {$1700.00} be refunded immediately and Wells Fargo retrieve the money via Visa/the Merchant based on provided proof and communications sent to Wells Fargo multiple times. We should not have to wait for Wells Fargo to retrieve the funds from the Merchant because you were provided with the documentation and proof that this was a fraudulent transaction due to bad /misrepresented services received.

I then called our home owners insurance agent and met with him in his office and I called Wells Fargo with the insurance agent present and after an hour and a half of talking with 2 different customer service agents, the customer service agent admitted that Wells Fargo knowingly continued to allow for the XXXX XXXX insurance amount even after we had switched our policy over to XXXX and now they are requiring us to make up the difference all at once now starting XX/XX/XXXXand that they only allowed for 6 months worth of property taxes instead of the entire year 's amount, which is why they are trying to convince us that our property taxes and home owners insurance has significantly increased. They are also telling us that they now require a minimum balance of {$760.00} in our escrow account at all times for which they did not notify us or disclose to us. Our insurance agent told them that this is not right to to do that to their clients and the service agent agreed with him that it is not right for Wells Fargo to do this.

I am praying that, as the first matter was resolved satisfactorily, I also hope this matter too can be rectified. I've been a loyal Capital One cardholder, on and off, for over 12 years. I was very surprised on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX to learn that one ( 1 ) of my active capital one credit card accounts were suddenly placed on restriction and are now in the process of being closed due to inactivity. After speaking to the customer service representative, and an escalations manager, ( XXXX in Tampa ) I was informed that because my account was closed on XXXX XXXX that attempting to have the account reopened was too far beyond the redemptive period. This was disheartening to hear considering the email I just received said the account was restricted and would be closed on XX/XX/XXXX. Meaning it was not closed yet. To add injury to insult, her telling me the account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX was the first time I had ever even heard of this. I was never alerted to anything prior to me receiving an email on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. The representative in Tampa asked for my mailing address in which I provided and said I should have received a letter stating my account was closing. To this date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I have not received anything from Capital One except for the email I received on the morning of the XX/XX/XXXX. This was really a harsh stance coming from Capital One considering that, Ive never missed a payment on any of my Capital One accounts in over 10 years, and also that I was never warned that I would be in jeopardy of losing the account due to its inactivity. If I would have been made aware beforehand, I wouldve gladly utilized this account .Not only to prevent a forced closure from occurring, but to also protect my credit profile. I am really worried how my credit is going be affected by this, as my available credit is going to be reduced significantly. Maintaining my credit rating is of utmost importance to me as some of the treatments I received are financed. Because of this, any substantial drop in credit score can affect my ability to finance my treatments/and or cost me more in interest to maintain the same level of service Ive been receiving. Closing this card could potentially create a financial hardship for me. As I think back to the previous experience I had with Capital One, although it was resolved, this created a fear within me ( of them closing my accounts ) of adding authorized users back to my cards. And by me not utilizing this option, I feel this was a precursor to me not having the activity I needed to keep this account open. I am ok with Capital One meeting their business requirements, and making account adjustments when they are required, but in my case I was never alerted to ANYTHING. I bank with other financial institutions and have encountered situations like this before in the past, but never have I been treated so harshly and unfairly, especially without recourse.

I told Mr. XXXX that I was not aware of the debt and could he give me more information, such as an exact date that the account was opened, when the account went into collections, etc. He could not give me exact dates on anything. He then proceeded to tell me the car that I was driving in XXXX and listed several of my family members that I listed as references when I opened the account. This is when red flags went up, because I would have never listed those sources as references for something like a loan. 

As such, I continued the conversation with Mr. XXXX. I asked what my options were and he said that we could settle or that I could dispute the claim in court. I then asked him to send me a document stating the nature and details of the debt and a link to pay the settlement. He told me that he would but then advised that they were not set up to take online payments. We ended the call, but I still could not remember this debt.

Plus I was receiving no service from Chase for that year though if they wanted a reasonable amount about for 2 or 3 weeks service, I would consider that. I day or 2 after that cancellation I received a statement showing a {$15.00} late fee on top of the {$96.00} fee that I thought in all fairness would be pro-rated.

I received a letter from a "" senior service specialist ""  saying that the {$25.00} annual fee was assessed in XXXX of 2018 ( news to us as we received no correspondence ) and was considered valid.

I received a letter from Wells Fargo in XXXX of XXXX notifying me they were closing my home improvement revolving account because the other member on the account had filed bankruptcy. I informed Wells Fargo that I would continue to make the payments ( {$110.00} per month ) on the account in accordance with the terms and conditions I had agreed to since I wasn't the one that filed bankruptcy. Wells Fargo noted to me on the phone that payments were no longer necessary because of the other member 's bankruptcy filing. ( The member filed a Chapter XXXX ). Regardless though, I continued to make the monthly payments on the account because I did not want this to affect my credit report. They're initial reporting to my XXXX credit report read account closed but the following month the reporting changed to "" Pays as Agreed '' every month until XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo reported to XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX the account was less than 2 months past due in the amount of {$190.00}. I was furious because I knew this to be incorrect. My credit score dropped by over 70 points. I tried logging into the account to see what was going on but the account was no longer accessible. I checked my emails ... .nothing. I received no notification from Wells Fargo the account was ever late but they were receiving my payments because the balance on my credit report reflected that. I spoke with a Wells Fargo Rep on XX/XX/XXXX. He told me he didn't know what triggered a past due payment of {$190.00} because his records showed payments received every month. He also said there was no longer a due date on the account since the account was charged off due to the other member 's bankruptcy filing. I filed a dispute with XXXX  on or about XX/XX/XXXX ; "" Account Never Late ''. On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo reported to XXXX "" past due changed from {$190.00} to {$1900.00} and Bad Debt placed for collection ''. The {$1900.00} is the balance due on the account. The initial balance on the account was {$7100.00} back in XX/XX/XXXX to replace the HVAC unit to be paid over 60 months at 0 % interest. The first payment due date was XX/XX/XXXX. 
My issues here : 1. If Wells Fargo 's policy is to demand payment in full when a joint member on the account files bankruptcy, they should at least give the other member the opportunity to satisfy that demand or come to an agreement before sending a negative credit reporting to the credit bureau and ruining one 's credit rating, and especially since I continue to make the monthly payments as noted in the original terms and conditions on the account AND was not the one that filed bankruptcy. 
2. Second, how am I to know about this if Wells Fargo doesn't allow access to the account anymore or leave phone messages or send emails? The Wells Fargo rep I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX said ... '' you'll just have to check in with us from time to time. We know it's an inconvenience but that's just our policy ''. I was in disbelief on that one! 
3. Third, why demand payment in full when they have been receiving more than the minimum monthly payments on the account despite an active Chapter XXXX bankruptcy filing at the time by the other member on the account. Doesn't that show them I intend to honor my agreement with them? I'm given them no reason to the contrary. 

Bottom line. How in the XXXX are they allowed to report a Bad Debt to ones credit report when no payment has ever been missed on the account?

They assumed this mortgage from XXXX XXXX and have been generally horrible, especially for escrow   related issues. They performed an escrow analysis shortly after assuming this mortgage upon my request, which found a deficit and they subsequently raised my minimum monthly payment, BUT they have refused all of my attempts to try to pay this deficit to try to reduce this payment amount again. I literally sent them {$300.00}, which essentially is the amount of the deficit to try to get them to reverse the payment increase and after being on a phone call today for over 2 hours, and it being escalated all the way from a general employee, to a supervisor, to a manager, I was told there was nothing they could to because their policy does not ever permit customers ( including VA Loan customers ) to pay the amount of a deficit. I am so angry about this policy because XXXX XXXX never did this. Also, M & T Bank actually told me on phone calls on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX that they they would get it done. I was concerned that I had not received the new analysis and so I called again today and was told that there was nothing they could do. 

I separately contacted the SCRA division of M & T Bank to try to get their help and they refused to do anything. Please make them stop doing this practice. 

A secondary issue is also that they make it very difficult to set up automatic payments to have the mortgage pay early.

I have applied for co-signer release in the past and again in XX/XX/XXXX. I found out today on XX/XX/XXXX that I was rejected again. Despite showing proof of almost XXXX in income and an impeccable credit history. There is not a single negative mark on my credit, nor is there a single reported late payment on anything. When I submitted the application with their "" executive office '' I wrote a letter, provided my XXXX 's, several paystubs, bank statements and I even offered to supply my new husbands ' income as we were recently married. I also started a second job in XX/XX/XXXX and am projected to make well over $ XXXX on my own without including any of my husbands income this year. 

I feel like a number on a piece of paper- my credit score is being dragged down by the debt to income ratio, but did they even bother to look at my credit history- that I have well established credit over the last 12 years with not a single late payment?!? I will never ever do business with Wells Fargo again. I have been a loyal customer and dedicated to making my payments on time and even staying months ahead by paying well in advance and I am infuriated that they will not grant me one ounce of faith or grace in this situation- as my co-signer had granted me his faith and his grace in the past. 

Now my co-signer is fed up. He owns several businesses and properties and is constantly having to explain this random student loan linked to his credit. He is threatening to pay the loan off and charge me 4 times the minimum monthly payment ( my minimum is {$270.00}, thus that would equal {$1100.00} per month instead ) so that it would be payed off in XXXX XXXX years- that would drown me. Both my husband and I are hard working Americans. We owed an additional {$5000.00} in taxes this year and I can not believe that Wells Fargo would put me into this situation. 

I hope there is something that CFPB can do to help me as all I would like is to have my co-signer removed and Wells Fargo has treated me as less than human.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,CA,927XX,451965,1767808000000,OCC,1479499000000,170894000000,Washington,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34

Have multiple products. Applied and was pre-approved for a {$30000.00} auto loan some days before XX/XX/XXXX. The offer came with a number I used to show the dealership. The first problem was that the dealership had troubling contacting the auto lending arm on XX/XX/XXXX, when i purchased the car. The dealership used the pre-approval # furnished to complete the paperwork and i signed and left the lot. The following Monday the dealership called to let me know that the Bank did not approve of the "" new '' car rate but higher "" used '' car rate because the car was new but from the previous calendar year. It was very inconvenient but more problematic, had I know the higher rate would be applied, while at the dealership, i may have bargained for a lower alternate financing offer, but at that point it was too late ; we only wanted to close the deal and go home. Had to drive across the county to sign new paperwork. 

Issue 2 : The pre-approval message is electronic and provides a "" new '' and "" used '' rate and does not define that in the email message. The customer has to click a link in the email message to get to an agreement letter. The information you need to figure this is out is on page two ( have to click to next page or scroll ) of the agreement that you click on. It is very difficult to find and there is no reason why it should not be spelled on in the email message that even new cars from the prior calendar year are not eligible for the "" new '' car rate. 

Issue 3 : It was nearly impossible to get to customer service for the auto lending division. It is not connected to the main bank. You have to use a different set of numbers and i tried over two days, no less than three times, with crazy wait times to finally speak to a loan officer who could explain the issue and could do nothing about it. 

Issue 4 : How come a XXXX ( previous year ) car with 22 miles on it can be considered "" used '' by a finance company when purchased in XX/XX/XXXX? Its not as if the manufacturing made any significant changes in the safety or other features of the car. It is completely arbitrary and outrageous. Three years maybe, five years definitely, one year - not at all.

My complaint is about Wells Fargo ( my home mortgage lender, "" WF '' ) requiring me to obtain flood insurance for my condominium that is located on the third floor of my building, due to my building now being zoned into a FEMA flood zone. If a flood were to occur ( where WF is indicating a 1 % chance of a flood occurring in my zone ), my building would be impacted but my third floor condo would not be impacted. Therefore, having a flood insurance policy would be unnecessary for me to obtain and WF requiring me to do so causes me unnecessary financial cost. In fact, if I opt not to purchase a policy, WF will require impound account fees to cover a flood insurance premium to their liking which would cost me even more unnecessary financial cost. 

WF did offer to accept a flood insurance policy of the Homeowners Association for the building. But such a policy if obtained by the Association will only cover common areas outside of my condo ( i.e. walls out policy ), where its coverage won't impact the condo that WF has the lien on regardless.

3226221,2019-04-29,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Chase Bank Dispute # XXXX To Whom it May Concern, XXXX XXXX , XXXX is an American veteran-owned company. Several months ago, we were informed by a Chase bank representative that a services dispute with a vendor, XXXX, had been resolved ; however, I received another billing statement and found that we had been re-billed. In fact, this happened twice. We made an inquiry and was told that XXXX   had submitted a rebuttal in an arbitration process of which we weren't part of the process. We never received a copy of the rebuttal nor were we able to respond to their unfounded statements until it reappeared. 

The business relationship with XXXX started out with promise. Our management team saw an opportunity to scale our company and to hire military spouses as salespeople. XXXX   was a 'new ' hiring company in the military spouse community and we reached out to them to see if they could help our company. It was a pleasant meeting and after hearing our sales needs, we were given two options of what they could do for us : # 1 ) XXXX would hire qualified sales people and XXXX XXXX would train and manage them ... or, # 2 ) XXXX would hire qualified sales people and XXXX would train, manage, and/or replace any of them for sales non-performance. 

We chose Option # 2. The program was to last for 90-days, the first 30-days would be to hone the sales program, vet, hire and train a sales team of qualified individuals. The next 60-days would be a boots-on-the ground cold-calling sales effort.

XXXX did manage to hire some people ( 5 out of the original 8 we had agreed upon ). We paid them {$4000.00} ( {$800.00} per hire ) using our Chase Bank corporate credit card. Within a very short period of time, it became evident that they did not hire qualified people nor train or manage them as they had promised in the agreement. Additionally, XXXX did not give us the full 60-days of sales efforts as promised in the written contract. And further, the issue ( character assassination ) they later raised in an arbitration filing ( which we were not notified of ) had no legal bearing on the dispute itself. Our dispute with Chase Bank is about XXXX ' poor quality-of-service and lack of performance. It was always about finding, training, and managing the right sales people, not about waiting for credit card machines or clouding the real issue with personal attacks. XXXX ' practices were fraudulent from the beginning. They never had any intention of providing the services as we had agreed to and paid for. The lack of performance by the salespeople they found is concrete evidence that they did not properly vet, train, or manage any of the people they provided as sales people. In fact, the company ( XXXX  ) has re-branded under a different corporate name and no longer provides the services they had promised us in our business relationship. 

We made a complaint with Chase Bank who reversed the charges in our favor, not once, but twice. However, they re-billed the charges both times without explanation or notification as to why. The reversed charges just appeared on our billing statements. Recently, we were told that we no longer had any recourse to dispute because we had reached a 118-day timeline in their process. We were never told that there was a 118-day dispute period. We believe this is a process breakdown and not about the merits of our dispute. All of our points were clearly outlined in the dispute packet we sent to Chase. We believe Chase has aided and abetted a company selling false goods and services and is using the unknown 118-day timeline criteria as a means to not take responsibility. This leads us to wonder why the dispute was reversed twice in our favor and twice in their favor.

XXXX XXXX, et al. Michigan Supreme Court B. DEFENDANTS KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACTION As previously stated, defendants must also show that they did not in fact have knowledge of the pendency of the action in order to be entitled to relief under MCR 2.612 ( B ). This Court has not considered what is required for a party to have knowledge in fact under MCR 2.612 ( B ), but this Court has generally taken care to acknowledge that a difference in specificity exists between the phrase actual knowledge and mere knowledge. See, e.g., XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) ( opinion by XXXX, XXXX. ) ( explaining that when the Legislature [ is ] careful to use the term actual knowledge, and not the less specific word knowledge, we determine that the Legislature meant that constructive, implied, or imputed knowledge is not enough ). 
But MCR 2.612 ( B ) does not simply use the word knowledge ; rather, it states that a defendant may be relieved of a judgment if the defendant did not in fact have knowledge of the pendency of the action.... ( Emphasis added. ) In fact is defined as [ a ] ctual or real ; resulting from the acts of parties rather than by operation of law. XXXX Law Dictionary ( 9th ed ). This definition further distinguishes actual knowledge from  constructive or implied knowledge of the pending action. Thus, we conclude that the plain language of MCR 2.612 ( B ) permits a defendant to seek relief from a default judgment as long as the defendant did not have actual knowledge of the pending action XXXX XXXX XXXX conveniently left out the fact the judgment they obtained was a Default Judgment. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX skipped steps and did not make a diligent effort to serve or notify Defendant. As a result XXXX & XXXX provided false information to the XXXX XXXX court for the purpose of obtaining a default judgment.

TIAA Bank recently sent me a letter telling me my monthly payment is about to go up over {$150.00} a month.

However I have expressed to them several times that I understand TIAA bank purchased the loan since I know this happens in the mortgage world, however they need to honor the terms and conditions of the original loan and those terms and conditions were not there. 
I did not sign the agreement with TIAA bank, but with XXXX. I don't think they can legally add additional terms and conditions to an existing loan. If they purchased the loan, they should have purchased the loan as it was. 

I have also requested a deep escrow analysis since there seems to be funds missing from the escrow account. Please help me resolve this issue.

3213002,2019-04-15,Debt collection,Credit card debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Hello, We previously had a credit card with Capital One in my wife 's name, 'XXXX   '. We had some difficulty and fell behind, then the account went to collections. We received a letter in XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX offering a settlement on behalf of Capital One for account ending in XXXX ( Ref # XXXX ). The original amount of debt is {$1900.00}, but they were offering a settlement in the amount of {$990.00} in 12 monthly payments of {$82.00}. We started making payments in XX/XX/XXXX. Since then we have made three payments and the fourth is currently in the mail. The letter stated at the end of this process they were going to provide a letter stating our debt has been resolved. We have not received any other communication from either XXXX XXXX XXXX or Capital One since we started making payments. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received a summons from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on behalf of Capital One ( File # XXXX ). The Summons and Complaint is seeking the full {$1900.00} minus {$82.00}. Now we are confused. We have been making payments and the checks have been getting cashed or cleared for three months. The fourth payment is in the mail. Suddenly, we receive this summons. There is definitely something deceptive or unfair about this process, either from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or Capital One. 

XXXX we tried to call Capital One, but was routed to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and spoke to a representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX, 'XXXX ' on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX for File number XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) . We explained our situation and he said he could not provide any legal advice. We let 'XXXX ' know we would like to submit a complaint about this process and the treatment we are receiving. We also asked if maybe a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may be warranted as well, but 'XXXX ' could not give us any guidance on that. He said he would route our complaint to Capital One right away and he would get back to us on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. He did not call so I tried to contact his office, but was placed on hold and then to a voicemail. I left a message and then went to the CFPB site to file this complaint. 

As a follow up to this, we are submitting our letter as well as a screen capture of the checks in the amount of {$82.00} being cleared by our bank. 

Ideally, we would like this summons and complaint to be cleared, and we would like to continue on the agreement and terms we are currently executing or the debt to be cleared by Capital One.

Note that many years ago I had previously cancelled an XXXX XXXX  card before due to the same deceptive loan practices. 
The card statement terms and conditions clearly state : You have a deferred interest promotion ( s ) expiring on XX/XX/XXXX. You must pay each deferred interest promotional balance in full by its expiration date to avoid paying accrued interest charges. Please see the promotional purchase summary section on this statement for further details. 
Deferred interest : To avoid paying Accrued lnterest Charges on any deferred interest promotion ( s ), you must pay at least your minimum payment due, if any, each month and the entire applicable Promotional Balance by the Expiration Date. 
Eligible card purchases may be billed under one of the following promotions : No Interest if Paid in Full within 6, 12, 24, months. 
We will charge this fee it we do not receive the total minimum payment due on your account BY 5 p.m. ( ET ) on the due date. 

1. The XXXX XXXX card statement ( attached ) calculated {$25.00} a month minimum payment. However I calculated {$75.00} a month for 11 months and {$74.00} as the final - 12th month payment. I had already made a payment of {$75.00} in XX/XX/XXXX for the XX/XX/XXXX deadline due date. This payment had been credited to my account. The terms state To avoid paying Accrued lnterest Charges on any deferred interest promotion ( s ), you must pay at least your minimum payment due HOWEVER I WOULD accrue interest if I only paid the minimum payment. See # 2 for more issues related to this deception. 
2. As I stated in complaint # 1 above The XXXX XXXX card calculated {$25.00} a month minimum payment. However I calculated {$75.00} a month for 11 months and {$74.00} as the final - 12th month payment. I had already made a payment of {$75.00} in XX/XX/XXXX for the XX/XX/XXXX deadline due date. This payment had been credited to my account. Synchrony does not provide these valid payments on their system. It appears they want to trick consumers. Read on to complaint # 3. 
3. I had calculated {$75.00} a month for 11 months and {$74.00} as the final - 12th month payment. However the Synchrony system blocked me from entering the last scheduled payment of {$74.00}. I tried at different times that on XX/XX/XXXX to make the entry and I was still blocked. Highly deceptive and manipulative in my opinion. Read on it gets worst 4. So I contacted and DOCUMENTED ( attached ) the live chat with a customer service agent ( XXXX and her manager, XXXX ) and told her that the system would not allow me to schedule the last payment. I direct you to the attached terms and conditions which I have also excerpted at the beginning of this complaint. I was making early payments and was told I would incur late fees. I was also told that should I pay off the balance early I would also incur a late fee. Look at the attached script and you will see that I was very clear and concise when I told the agent XXXX that I had already made a payment in XX/XX/XXXX for the XX/XX/XXXX payment and that I could not enter the XX/XX/XXXXlast payment. The degree of deception that I was witness to was appalling and sickening : '' XXXX, I see that all your payments are scheduled for the 10th of every month. However, the due date id the 01st. You will incur late charges. If the payments are not processed by the 01st of every month, late fee will be charged for all your payments. '' "" I am referring to the future payments. Also, early payments are not considered for future billing cycle. '' "" The payments need to be processed after the statement is generated and by the due date. '' "" I am sorry for all these confusion ; however, please know that early payments might also result in late charges. '' "" Yes, early payments are not considered for future billing cycle. '' In response to me stating that I would pay off the balance : "" Thus, will result in late fee. '' Her manager also chimes in. He apparently is making up his own terms and conditions above and beyond what is documented in the statement : "" The due date is 1st of each month. The payment has to be made after the statement date and by the due date. '' Her manager contradicts the customer service agent and says that if I pay off the balance that night would there be no penalty. "" Yes. There will be no penalty. '' I have a discount credit of {$50.00} that is being processed through XXXX by the merchant that I purchased the guitar from ( RE : XXXX XXXX ).

That caused them to think that I was late on my payment which then caused them to contact me about it. I have always had my mortgage payment set up on a recurring auto draft from my checking account with XXXX XXXX and therefore am never late. I informed them I hadn't changed anything and wasn't late. Different customer service people continued calling me for several months and I continued stating the same thing and eventually one of them finally actually researched and found the mistake which was in fact that Chase had misapplied my payment and it was an internal error and opened a research request to have it fixed. However, they continued to call me and I would have to repeatedly explain myself over and over and over. This went on for months. In the midst of all of this, my property taxes increased which caused my monthly payment to increase so I went onto my online banking auto draft and updated the amount. However, somehow, it also turned off the recurring auto payment without my knowledge. So in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I was in fact late due to my auto draft accidentally being turned off. But when Chase called to tell me I was late ( yet again ), I informed them that it was their mistake as I had been telling them and to research it and to pleaseeeee get it corrected. But it was actually late. But because of the headache that had been going on for months due their mistake ( which they have admitted and finally corrected ) - I ignored the calls. Then, I happened to be on my online banking account and discovered the issue and of course immediately turned auto draft back on and caught up on the 2 actual late payments. Again, all of this confusion occurred due to Chase 's initial mistake and their horrible customer service, lack of follow through on research requests to correct the misapplication of payment, etc. Now, I am trying to apply for a new mortgage and because of this chain of events - i am not able to get approved because of this late payments. I have opened ANOTHER Credit Amendment Dispute because the last one was denied but this time, I did actually get a helpful customer service representative on the phone who researched and said himself that it is clear that this not -- normal for me late occurrence was "" due to the initial misapplication of my payment back in XX/XX/XXXX at the fault of Chase - not me - which put everything out of wack. '' I need these late payments removed from my credit report under these unique circumstances. I have tried and tried and tried to get this resolved with Chase with no success and that is why I feel I have to come to you as a last resort. I even went in to a Chase Bank local office trying to get help since every time for months, different people would contact me and no one would ever know what was going on and I would have to educate yet another person that they misapplied the payment and sit on hold for forever while they learned about the case - but the local guy wasn't allowed to help me nor talk to a XXXX customer service rep on my behalf. I just wanted one dedicated individual that could help me get it fixed and they couldn't even deliver that level of customer service which is so disappointing and has been incredible frustrating. They also reported a {$17000.00} "" charge off '' on my credit report for a credit card that wasn't even in my name and was not mine! I am waiting for that to be corrected right now as well. They said since I was an authorized user on the account ( which was fraud, I am not an authorized user for anyone ) that I wasn't financially obligated for the debt and that it shouldn't have been reported on my credit score - yet it is.

The checks issued by XXXX  XXXX  XXXX XXXX are written to my wife and I, and the mortgage company, Navy Federal. My claims specialist at Navy Federal is XXXX XXXX and the incident number is XXXX. Her phone number is XXXX XXXX option 1. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent XXXX XXXX a receipt where I paid XXXX dollars in cash to a tree company to remove a tree that was through the roof of my house and wrapped up in a powerline. The insurance company approved this amount and verified that the receipt I provided was enough for them to release payment to reimburse me for my out of pocket expense. XXXX asked me for more proof that this money was spent such as a withdrawal from a bank which I did not have as this was cash my wife and I had saved for a rainy day, such as a tree crashing through our roof during a hurricane.

I never received an email statement nor a paper statement telling me that there was a {$82.00} balance due and I have several accounts and I keep track of all the accounts and make timely payments as I receive statements. My credit score has always been about 785 FICO with the 3 Credit reporting Agencies. Today, my credit score dropped to XXXX due to the fact that BLOOMINGDALES CREDIT reported 30 days LATE Payment to the Bureaus. I immediately contacted the Bloomingdales Credit Department and after waiting ror over 45 minutes being on hold, I was able to speak to Ms. XXXX in Bloomingdales Credit Department I explained the entire situation to her that I never received a statement via email for the past 2 months which I always receive on a monthly basis and I requested that the 30 day past due late payment reported to the credit bureaus be removed and show as being current since it is not my fault that I never received a statement from Bloomingdales and how can I be held responsible. 

The only was I found out that my payment was past due was because I received a phone call from Bloomingdales Customer Service after 2 months letting me know to call Bloomingdales for an important business matter and when I called Bloomingdales Customer Service, I immediately made the payment of {$44.00} and Customer Servicve removed the {$38.00} late fee on the account which brought the balance down to {$0.00}. Since I was on the recorded line with Bloomingdales and they informed me in the beginning of the phone call that all calls may be monitored for quality assurance purposes, I was told by the Bloomingdales Customer Service that there would be no negative reporting to any credit bureaus and I am sure that conversation was recorded on the Bloomingdales phone line since they record calls like the rest of the companies for quality assurance reasons. 

I even requested to speak to a Bloomingdales Credit Department Supervisor and she even refused to assist me in this matter. I explained to her that it was Bloomingdales fault that I had not received statements from them for the past 2 months and she was another rude person just trying to state the facts the the negative reporting would not be removed. I have no where to go to but to come here and pleasd to your organization. 

I recently applied fr a new mortgage application and my mortgage loan wold be denied if they see that there is a recent 30 day late payment on my credit bureaus from Bloomingdales.

Citibank was one of the ones that seemed to have the best offer. After putting in all of my personal information I saw nothing at all about any fees - this is why I chose this bank. 

After running my credit, I get an approval and then it shows a balance transfer fee which seemed extremely high. I immediately called and spoke to a representative and she transferred me to another representative. I explained my frustration and how this was misleading and she told me that there was no balance transfer fee in the promotional period. I asked again to confirm and she said there was no fee. Potentially there may have been a language barrier but she clearly said no fee. 

I then get the card a few days later and transfer my balances. When I get my bill, I see that there are fees and that they were not credited. I called back into Citibank and talked to a representative and she says her manager will listen to the calls and call me back. I receive no call whatsoever. 

I call in again and speak to someone and they say the calls were searched but they didn't find any conversations about fees. The only calls I had were about fees!! I feel like I've been lied to once again. 

He offers to credit me back the fees if I transfer my balances to another card. That was insulting. Also it's simply setting me up for another XXXX. 

Citibank has given me the worst experience. Terrible customer service. Blatant XXXX and very sneaky and misleading advertising that discloses nothing about fees. They know that consumers don't want to continually get their credit pulled, so they don't disclose this information until after they've checked your credit.

As an existing Wells Fargo credit card customer, they have the right to use my customer information to market to me. 

I applied for the card at the end of XXXX and finally received my card on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to Wells Fargo representatives about the account on XX/XX/XXXX, and then several times after that when I was surprised to see that I had a minimum payment due.

On XX/XX/XXXX I saw an interest charge when reviewing my online statement. I contacted the company to correct the error, as I was within the 12 month promotional period. I was told that because I had opened a Wells Fargo XXXX Visa in XX/XX/XXXX, I was ineligible for a promotional rate. 

Wells Fargo had ample opportunity to notify me of this during any of several previous calls about this account. Further, Wells Fargo should not have marketed to me offering a 0 % promotional rate if I was ineligible. Further still, I believe that opening a card on XX/XX/XXXX is more than 12 months away from the second open date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

This was deceptive and deprived me of the ability to manage my finances. I can not close this card without repercussions to my credit. I can not open another card with a different provider without repercussions to my credit.

I called Citibank in mediately and talk to a representative there who said it was not their true fraud representative and they would stop any further purchases immediately and send me a new credit card. she also recommended that I change my mobile phone number, which I did, so that the person could not access my phone for further access and possibly get more personal information. after receiving the next billing statement that itemized all purchases I about fell over because {$20000.00} worth of transactions were purchased within 2 hours on my card in XXXX.

I called chase bank customer Sevice and advised them that I received such an email and chase bank ask me to go personally to the branch to report any fraud. On that same day I went to XXXX branch of chase and spoke to an employee named XXXX and he let me spoke to fraud Dept and just advise me to forward the email to XXXX and stated I dont have to do anything. 
On XX/XX/XXXX when I checked my balance my two accounts both checking and saving account was withdrawn in the amount of XXXX XXXX from checking and XXXX from savings Acct. I called chase bank as soon as I found out and filed a dispute about the incident. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I also went to XXXX chase branch to complain and informed them that there were two withdrawals and we found out that transactions were occurred at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, nj. On that day The funds were returned temporarily. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from chase indicating that the funds thats were returned has been reversed and that chase bank claimed that the withdrawals were made with a chipped card and the return would not be honored. I called the claim dept about this matter but unfortunately they just told me that the card will be impossible to be tampered since its a chip to chip basis. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to go to the police station and report the incident because my Savings account turned all into negative. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I recieved a final report from the assigned detective for my case and he exhibited a report based from the video surveillance as an evidence that it was not me who withdrawn the money. I sent The report to chase claim department on that same day but unfortunately the case was still denied and did not honor the report. At this time chase bank has been charging me of XXXX dollars fee for not maintaining the balance and on top of this my checking and savings account are currently negative. 
I am sending this letter to your office to let you know and asking for help since I am a victim of this criminal case and that chase bank has never honored all my evidence since I had received the email despite all the eveidence I had provided. I do believe that my case was not investigated in thouroughly and in a fair manner. Chase bank should have the reponsibility to protect Their consumers. I do believe this is negligence on the part of chase bank by giving my information to this thief without asking proper identification and without giving me proper notifications.

I had been earning points with no problem and redeemed XXXX points in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I upgraded my MasterCard in XX/XX/XXXX to a XXXX XXXX MasterCard. 

My statements no longer reflected the total points earned like the previous card did. It only showed how many points earned that statement period. Since I didn't need to use the points I didn't keep up with the accumulated points. 

Sometime early in XX/XX/XXXX I was curious to see how many points I had and I went on my Citibank online account and it referred me to the XXXX site to check my point balance. When I did this it did not show any points earned on that MasterCard. 

I called CitiBank to inquire and they could not tell me what the problem was but that they would look into it and get back to me. Since then I would call both XXXX and Citibank to see if they would fix the problem and periodically but neither would take any real action to resolve the matter. 

It's now over a year and the problem is yet to be resolved. XXXX has no record of my points from the Citi MasterCard. 

If I thought this was any more than a quick fix I would have kept track of every correspondence with CitiBank and XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was finally able to talk to a supervisor named XXXX, who seemed genuinely concerned and that he would call me back after looking into it. He did call back about a week later and said that the problem was detected and it was an email issue. He said to wait 2 statement cycles and the points will appear on XXXX. I waited 3 statement cycles before contacting CitiBank and XXXX again because my points had not yet appeared on my account. 

Now, after endless calls and emails to supervisors at XXXX and CitiBank I still do not have my points. I have have had many calls lasting well over an hour, sometimes 2 hours being transferred back and for between CitiBank and XXXX and each claiming the other company is responsible for the problem. 

I received a survey request from Citibank after one of the phone calls I made on XX/XX/XXXX, this year. In that survey I conveyed my frustration about this lingering unresolved issue. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email regretting my difficulty and inconvenience and offering to assist me if I called. I immediately called and he said he would try to help.

During this time as I waited for XXXX to receive the funds behind the scenes Chase Fraud department had realized that the check XXXX received was fraudulent. 
Chase giving XXXX the run around telling her that the check was fraudulent and that they would see how they could enable her to receive the wire I sent. Chase intimated to XXXX that they would close out her account as a result of the fraudulent check and will issue her a check with whatever balance she had along with my wired funds. 
XXXX informed our colleague that she of the above as we waited for XXXX to receive the check issued by Chase to close out her account.

I then inquired if there was a branch manager I could speak to and was advised she was with a client. A message was taken and the banker told me that the message would be given to Mrs. XXXX XXXX. 

Note all during this time I remained in contact with Mrs. XXXX by emailing her on the following days XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ), XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX for updates and or disposition on the return of my funds or the issuance of the check. 

Inquiring about the status of the check, accuracy of information provided regarding the closure of account, issuance or processing of check and anticipated delivery arrival time. All to which I did not ever receive any response to my emails. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Chase bank again speaking to XXXX and she informed me that the recipients account had been closed due to her receiving a fraudulent check and a check has been processed closing out her account with whatever balance she had in her account and the check would include my wire transfer. 

XXXX also stated the wire had been returned to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX  resent the wire back XX/XX/XXXX. Which in checking with XXXX XXXX  they did no such thing since I did not advise them to take any action. ( an untruth ) XXXX also informed me that since the check had already been processed the wait time was half way over ( 5-10 business days ) leaving one more week to go before the recipient would receive the check. ( an untruth ) On XXXX I emailed Chase branch Manager XXXX XXXX that the recipient has yet to receive her check. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and was informed XXXX was out of the office and will return on XX/XX/XXXX. I left a message with XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Chase and XXXX answered. I informed her that the check had still not been received and she informed me that the processing of the check on XXXX ( when she had already told me was issued ) had been interrupted because my bank issued a recall on XX/XX/XXXX again my bank did no such thing.. XXXX informed me that since my bank did a recall the processing of the check was halted and I will now have to have my bank recall the funds. 

Wait if we did the recall as she alleged then why am I still calling about getting my money back here it is XX/XX/XXXX. 

While Chase was on the call on XX/XX/XXXX I walked into XXXX XXXX to the person whom I have been dealing with all along XXXX XXXX ( who sent the initial wire ) before emailing me to request the recipients DOB and phone number and address ( then XXXX XXXX XXXX who finalized the wire ). 

I informed XXXX that I had Chase bank on my cell and it was on speaker and they needed to resolve this. XXXX contacted his wire department XXXX XXXX ( Branch Manager ) for directions / instructions on how to recall the wire. He spoke to XXXX advising her XXXX XXXX will recall the wire today XX/XX/XXXX. 

Now in addition to all of this XXXX had previously been informed that as a result of the fraudulent check coming in at the same time as my wire the final or end result was Chase closing the account and allegedly issuing a check to the recipient. 

As a banker why didnt XXXX inquire of XXXX the Chase banker if the account is closed what kind of problems if any will XXXX XXXX   incur. That million dollar question was not posed. So later that day after making the attempt to recall the funds, I received an email from XXXX XXXX XXXX advising me that that they could not recall the funds because the Chase account is closed. And in the email from XXXX XXXX  XXXX I was told there was nothing more XXXX XXXX could do and I needed to sort it out with Chase. Really??? Arent you my bank On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Chase XXXX XXXX and was told by her she has done all she could and has spent several days and hours attempting to resolve this issue and it is up to XXXX XXXX   to resolve the matter as she has done all she can. In addition XXXX stated that she had not responded to any of my emails since she is limited to what she could say in them since I am not a customer of Chase Bank. 

I suspected that, however, at best I hoped she would surely have addressed the issues and concerns contained within. 

Now mind you I believe due to wiring funds to a customer of Chase who I believed was in good standing, I am an indirect customer of Chase.

We never shopped around because my daughter was very happy with TD services in the past 10 years. At the beginning, they offered a 30 year old mortgage with no points at 3.5 % fixed rate. Upon request, we provided all necessary documents TD asked for and through-out the process, we requested the closing to take place by XX/XX/XXXX since my daughters had to move out of their current apartment as others were scheduled to move in the next day. TD Bank consistently assured us that the closing WILL take place on time. To our surprise, a week before the closing date, TD started asking for the same documents that we had provided and waited to the last week for employment verification which they couldve done at the very beginning. The loan officer apologized for late handling and processing the case via email and phone calls. TD abject failure to deliver what was promised, caused the closing date to be postponed TWICE which caused us extreme hardship and added costs of living in a hotel for 4 nights and I had to postpone my flight twice. 
But, the most egregious part of the entire ordeal was when TD Bank inexplicably increased the interest rate to 4 % even-though we had a locked-in rate of 3.625 %, literally two days before the closing and after hundreds of phone calls, emails and texts begging them to honor what was agreed upon, they wouldnt budge and presented some bogus and questionable reasoning and justification. We strongly feel that TD kept us hostage and knowing that we had our belongings in a truck and living in a hotel, we had no other choice but to accept their unfair deal since we couldnt walk away. This was nothing but an extortion which I brought up to the attention of most TD staff including the Regional Sales Manger, but they couldnt care less. 
We even asked for some type of compensation for our additional expenses by a way of waving or reducing some of their fees and charges to no avail.

On XX/XX/XXXX, the Borrower, had a Mortgage loan held by Bank of America ( BOA ) with a beginning principal balance of {$430000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, BOA transferred the loan to XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) for servicing, which at that time of the transfer had a balance of {$420000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX entered into a Loan Adjustment Agreement ( LAA ) with the Borrower. 
Shortly after receiving XXXX first monthly statement, Borrower noticed that the statement did not accurately reflect the terms of the LAA. Upon noticing the inaccuracies, Borrower contacted XXXX numerous times to ask them to correct their monthly statements to no avail. On XXXX XXXX, the loan was transferred back to Bank of America. Borrower also contacted BOA on numerous occasions to ask them to correct their ledger to no avail. 
Contrary to the LAA, XXXX reduced the original unpaid principal balance of {$420000.00} by only {$24000.00}, and therefore incorrectly calculated the new principal balance as {$400000.00}. Pursuant to the LAA, the original principal balance of {$420000.00} should have been reduced by {$27000.00}, and the new principal balance should have been correctly reflected on XXXX statements and ledger as {$400000.00}. 
Also, contrary to the LAA, XXXX statements indicate that XXXX added {$51000.00} to their incorrectly calculated new principal balance, and that XXXX intends that the {$51000.00} be paid as a balloon payment on the maturity date. But, according the LAA, interest should be waived on {$51000.00} of the XXXX XXXX, and if the Borrower fails to make timely payment on the final {$51000.00} of the principal, then the waived interest on the {$51000.00} becomes due as a balloon payment on the maturity date. 
Also, XXXX statements and ledger incorrectly show a 4.5 % interest rate on the loan, but the LAA clearly states that the interest rate on the loan is fixed at 3.5 % for the remaining life of the loan. 
Because of XXXX deviations from the LAA,  XXXX ledger shows that, for the 28 months that the loan was with XXXX, the original principal balance was reduced by {$24000.00} and that the Borrower made total principal payments of only {$8800.00} ; for a combined total reduction of the original principal of {$32000.00}. Therefore, at the time the loan was transferred back to BOA for servicing, XXXX miscalculated the principal balance as {$390000.00} instead of the actual {$370000.00}.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BANK OF AMERICA NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,MD,209XX,480228,2258832000000,OCC,1906458000000,218605000000,Washington,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

After noticing that home prices were going down, my fianc and I decided to follow up with our lender on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Before restarting the application process, we also looked at the XXXX XXXX XXXX program however opted for BECU since the Home Ready program provided more benefits ( 3 % down payment assistance ) instead of XXXX XXXX ( {$2000.00} XXXX XXXX and {$1500.00} grant ). Although our income exceeded the XXXX XXXX AMI limit, I was under the impression that wed qualify for the down payment assistance program if we found a home that did not have an AMI limit ( per the Home Ready eligibility website ). With that in mind, my fianc and I looked for homes that fell under the No AMI Limit zones. During initial discussions with our loan officer and throughout the process, I asked about the down payment assistance program via phone and was confirmed by our loan officer multiple times that we would qualify for the down payment assistance program if we found a home in the No AMI Limit zones. 

With that in mind and since the application was still open, we decided to continue with the BECU application. From the start, the loan officer was not clear on what needed to be provided. Documents were requested in piecemeal. Paystubs were requested and submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. Additional documents ( XXXX, and recent bank statements ) were requested and submitted to our lender on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.

It wasn't until XX/XX/XXXX was it brought to our attention that there was an issue with my fiancs pay stub which was missing hours ( paystub reflected XXXX hrs. instead of XXXX, the underwriter questioned if my fianc was a full-time employee even though she had XXXX hrs. of overtime included in the same paystub ). For the pay period that included XXXX of XXXX, my fiancs employer did not include holiday pay which led to the discrepancy. A verification of employment was required and the authorization form was submitted to BECU on XX/XX/XXXX. Although the paystubs were the first documents submitted, it was not brought to our attention that'd it'd be an issue until over two weeks later. My fiancs employer replied back on XX/XX/XXXX and obtained conditional approval on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We visited a home on XX/XX/XXXX and signed a purchase contract on XX/XX/XXXX. Our loan officer reached out to us on XX/XX/XXXX with different mortgage scenarios and rate options available based on the points we would pay. After further review, I noted each scenario did not include the funds we would receive from the down payment assistance program. Out of concern, I emailed our loan officer the following on XX/XX/XXXX, I just wanted to confirm, is the estimates provided part of the Home Ready program? There was initial concerns that we made too much but I double check the property against the XXXX XXXX Home Ready eligibility portal and the home falls within a no income limit area. If so, when would the down payment assistance portion be calculated with closing estimates? On the same day, our loan officer replied back the following, Yes, you are correct! You will qualify for Home Ready as well as the grant program as the home is in a no income limit tract. This is wonderful! I am reserving the grant program funds for you now and will switch the product over to Home Ready after it comes out of underwriting. 

With that reassured, we performed a home inspection on XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX XXXX, we were informed by our loan officer that we would not qualify for the down payment assistance program. Since it was late in the evening, a manager was unavailable to speak to. I was contacted by the XXXX XXXX XXXX Sales Manager on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss the options available.

The manager contacted me on XX/XX/XXXX and informed me that BECU could not do anything about it. She indicated that since the grant funds was not included in the conditional approval letter, they would not provide assistance.

When I first attempted to deposit my checks, the ATM spit them out and asked me to redeposit them. I redeposited the checks and the machine began making loud noises and the door on the machine that accepted the deposits started opening and closing. It did this for about 5 minutes and the machine went out of service and then came back online, but it did not give me any images of checks being deposited, nor did I receive an email from PNC regarding my deposits being accepted by the machine. 

There was a car behind me and I drove away from the ATM to allow the other driver to use the ATM. However, I understand that driver also had issues receiving funds they chose to withdraw from their account. I then called inside the branch to report what had happened to me and also to the driver behind me. I went inside the branch and told them what was going on. I was directed to speak with a woman named XXXX XXXX, who had me to give her information about the deposit. I had maybe 15 checks or a little less that were deposited, but I told her I was unsure of the total amounts of each check, but that I had signed each of the checks and they were made payable either to my business, called XXXX XXXX, to XXXX, or made payable to me, XXXX XXXX. I estimated the amount for the checks in total exceeded {$4500.00} and I now believe they exceed {$5000.00}. The checks are tuition payments from parents who XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I then asked Ms. XXXX when the ATM was going to be services and she told me that she did not know because it belonged to an outside vendor. I told her that was an unacceptable answer because she seemed to be a person of authority at the bank and should know that kind of information. Ms. XXXX then told me she would follow up with me the next day, but did not and several days have gone by with no resolution. Meanwhile, the checks are still outstanding and have not been credited to my account and I need to have them credited and accounted for ASAP. I am able to give some identifying information as to the amounts of most of the checks and the payors. However, I believe that at this time, the checks should have been retrieved from the machine or at least the vendor should have been notified. I was not given the name of the vendor when I reported this issue. 

At this point, I need to be made whole with the checks being retrieved from that ATM, the checks being deposited into and credited into my account, and images of the checks sent to me via the email preference I have set on my account to be able to retrieve images. 

Apparently, PNC banks in the DC area frequently undergo issues with their ATMs ; 2 nights before that, I was at the ATM for a PNC bank located on the XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX in Washington, DC and while I attempted to use one of the outside ATMs to make a deposit, another customer was trying to use the other to withdraw funds. The other customer NEVER got her money and when I attempted to get into my account, the ATM machine I used NEVER as able to take my PIN number.

We were able to sign new renters to a short-term 6 month lease in XX/XX/XXXX. In the XXXX of XXXX, those renters became unreliable and we decided to move to a month-to-month rental with them ; while listing the house for sale at the same time. There was not one single offer at all on the home for 6+ months. The 2nd set of renters gave their 30 day notice to move out at the beginning XX/XX/XXXX. 
At the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX, [ After consultation with our realtor, the Veterans Administration ( VA ), and Wells Fargo Mortgage ( WFM ) ], we initiated the process of a Deed-In-Lieu ( DIL ) with both the VA and WFM. I have attached the following : 1 ) The formal request letter to WFM dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, 2 ) an email dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX documenting WFM representative XXXX XXXX confirmation that my wife and I had submitted all required paperwork necessary to begin processing our DIL request, 3 ) An email dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX from VA representative XXXX XXXX confirming WFM had completed an appraisal of the XXXX XXXX house on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX with an appraised value of XXXX, The renters moved out of the house at the end of XX/XX/XXXX and the home was vacant since that time. We continued to pay the monthly mortgage due ( on-time ) for both months of XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Money was getting tight while paying two mortgages on my wifes income and my retirement/disability pay. 

In early XX/XX/XXXX ; we received a Notice of Approval for a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure Letter from WFM dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX with a lot of information. The main points of concern were, Conditions that must be met You and all other occupants must vacate your property and the title must be clear and marketable by XX/XX/XXXX, the vacate date. Understand that any personal belongings left after XX/XX/XXXX, the vacate date become the property of Wells Fargo Bank N.A.,  Transfer/closing To complete the transfer of ownership of your home back to the owner of your mortgage, you must sign and complete all required documents provided to you by a third-party attorney, or title company acting on behalf of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ; we signed, dated, and faxed back our agreement to the terms of the approval for the Deed-in-Lieu to WFM. Furthermore ; I phoned XXXX XXXX XXXX, Home Preservation Specialist, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., phone : XXXX Ext XXXX. To inform him that the house was already vacant with all personal property removed and in marketable condition on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ; there was no need to wait until XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 

We did not have sufficient funds in reserve to pay for our XXXX  home 's XX/XX/XXXX mortgage and our XXXX home 's XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment. It was my understanding ( after my phone conversations with Mr XXXX ) that once we vacated the XXXX  home ( for purposes we are discussing here ) on the WFM mandated Vacate Date of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ... The House and ALL personal property with the house ; became the property of Wells Fargo Bank, N/A ; as per their letter dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. At which point, we were not responsible for further mortgage payments. ( This is due in part to the fact it was a VA backed mortgage, and Lenders can not report mortgage payments as being late until the 16th of the month on VA backed mortgages ). 

In this case, I would only have missed the XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment on the XXXX  house. I should not be showing as late on any following months as I was no longer in possession of the house. It doesn't make sense to be held financially responsible for thousands of dollars for three additional months ; for a home you were required to vacate for those months. 

It appears from an internet search on the property sales of the home, WFM eventually sold the house on XX/XX/XXXX for {$200000.00} ( see attached XX/XX/XXXX search from XX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX ). In addition, the Veterans Administration paid out approximately {$39000.00} and change to Wells Fargo Bank NA, to cover the deficiency balance between what was owed after the Deed in Lieu and the sale price on XX/XX/XXXX. So it appears that Wells Fargo ended up recouping a total of {$240000.00} for the XXXX  house. Which is pretty much a break even for them ; if not more than what I actually owed at the time of the Deed in Lieu. 

Which brings up the question ; was Wells Fargo Bank N.A., dragging this process out so that I could not afford to keep up with dual mortgage payments. In order for them to be able to collect the deficiency balance from the VA? In the WFM letter dated XX/XX/XXXX it states that if I was able to meet all of the conditions stated in the letter ... '' and the mortgage is released, the investor ( and other interested parties ) waives its right to seek a deficiency balance under the mortgage note and/or related documents. '' My main concern, at this point, is the fact that I know have to pursue a purchase of a new build home which is more XXXX compliant for myself, and an aging parent. In order to restore my full VA home loan entitlement, I had to repay the Veterans Administration the full amount it had to payout to Wells Fargo Bank, NA.. A total repayment on my part of the full {$39000.00} and change in the last 30 days. I can provide documentation of payment to the VA if requested. So, I have absolutely no outstanding federal debts, or obligations tied to this mortgage. 

I understand that the Deed in Lieu will be reflected on my credit report. The issue I am debating is how WFM is reporting the late payment status with the XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX credit bureaus. I have attached copies from the first three bureaus which were pulled on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I am waiting on a mailed report from XXXX. 

The XXXX payment status is reflecting, "" At least 120 days, or more than four payments past due. ( updated XX/XX/XXXX ), but the payment history is reflecting all current from XXXX XXXX. 

The XXXX payment status is reflecting, "" Credit grantor received deed for collatoral in lieu of foreclosure on a defaulted mortgage '' ( updatedXX/XX/XXXX ), and the payment history is reflecting XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX late, XX/XX/XXXX Late, XX/XX/XXXX Late, XX/XX/XXXX Negative. 

The XXXX  Payment status is relecting, "" 120 days past due '' ( updated XX/XX/XXXX ), and the payment history is reflecting XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX late, XX/XX/XXXX late. 

I am still waiting to see how the XXXX reporting is affecting my credit scores. 

I received a letter dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, from WF Home mortgage which states, '' We discovered a processing issue that affected our credit reporting. We apologize for this issue and we want to share the steps we have taken to address it. '' "" When the deed in lieu was finalized, the closed date wasn't furnished to the consumer reporting agencies. 

We've notified the consumer reporting agencies to include the correct date on your credit report. 

You may reach out to the consumer credit reporting agencies. They can confirm that they completed the updates ... '' The problem with this XXXX XX/XX/XXXX letter is that is does not identify the CORRECTED DATE the Deed in Lieu was supposed to be finalized and updated with at the consumer reporting agencies. It is totally vague! I waited a few weeks from the time I received the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX letter ; to give the consumer reporting agencies to update their systems. 
Then I did follow up with the credit reporting agencies on of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX was the only one with a XXXX update ( and I submit an incorrect update ). XXXX XXXX   last update was XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX last update was XX/XX/XXXX. 

It was at this point in XXXX that I began disputes with the three main credit bureaus and also contacted WFM directly to try and resolve this issue. 

I was put in contact with a Mr. XXXX XXXX, Executive Resolution Specialist, Customer Care and XXXX XXXX ( Phone :XX/XX/XXXX ) to act as my liaison through my dispute process with WFM. 

I sent WFM a fax request an update to reflect no missing payments to all of the consumer credit reporting agencies on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. ( See attached Fax dated XX/XX/XXXX ). 

I ended up receiving a letter dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX, Senior Vice President, Wells Fargo Home Lending. It stated they had received my inquiry and their goal would be to try and and provide a response by XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. ( See attached letter datedXX/XX/XXXX ) During the interval of time between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ; I had several conversations with Mr. XXXX ( some heated ones ) in regards to the status of my credit reporting dispute. We were unable to see eye-to-eye. I received WFM response to my dispute the evening of XX/XX/XXXX, from Mr. XXXX via email. It was less than satisfactory, in my opinion.

I did not have my reading glasses on when the sales lady pointed to a place below my signature on the receipt and asked me to initial it. Unfortunately, I could not read what I was initialing without my glasses. I thought my initials were for the {$600.00} special card and that I would call later to schedule it.

I went back to XXXX XXXX XXXX the next day, XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX XXXX I spoke with a salesman and said I was not happy with the product my bags came back very quickly. I said I had not opened the product and wanted a refund. The salesman said we do not allow refunds and I took out my cellphone and called Capital One, the credit card company that I used to purchase the product. A man a Capital One spoke with the salesman and then the salesman handed the phone back to me. The salesman told me to leave and would not give me a refund. That was around XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I later called Capital One disputes section again ( around XXXX XXXX ) to make sure it was documented. On XX/XX/XXXX I  looked at my Capital One statement and this charge was not disputed. So I called Capital One and the lady in Disputes said because the credit charge had not cleared on XX/XX/XXXX the information that both Capital One employees had entered into the system disappeared. She took down my information and started the dispute again. Capital One sent me a ltr dated XX/XX/2019 requesting that I respond to their letter if I still wanted to dispute the {$320.00} charge.

I told her I disagreed that I had never heard of a company requiring a customer to do such a thing. She said she would be mailing me their response in writing. 

So this complaint is about Capital One requiring a customer to get a second opinion about another company. I don't believe I could find another Spa that would be willing to do such an unethical thing. I tried to return the product within 24 hours of the purchase.

( Chase Auto ) has reported account delinquencies for a closed auto lease account without notifying me of any amount being owed and they have continued to refuse to provide an invoice or statement to me for the amount supposedly owed. The credit bureaus have since downgraded my credit rating and the delinquency is published on my credit reports. 

Description of dispute : I entered into a 36-month vehicle lease with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as assignee ) on XX/XX/XXXX. I made all 36 monthly payments associated with this account in-full, returned the leased vehicle on-time, and I have never received notice of an additional amount being owed via mail, electronic mail, or otherwise. My account with Chase closed the day that I returned the leased car and I have not received a statement since I returned the car to the XXXX dealership. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the day before I was due to leave on my honeymoon, I received a notification from my XXXX  credit monitoring service that Chase had reported a past-due balance of {$1600.00} on my Chase account and that the account was at least 30 days delinquent. I had no knowledge of what this {$1600.00} debt consists of. As a direct result of these negative reports to the credit bureaus, my credit score was lowered by 106 points. 

When I discovered the negative reports, I immediately submitted a dispute to XXXX, but Chase only confirmed to XXXX  the existence of the debt, which does not resolve the issue. A review of the online portal for the closed Chase account on XX/XX/XXXX revealed no current statements. 

I notified Chase by letter on XX/XX/XXXX that a delinquency was reported to the credit bureaus for a debt that I have never received a bill for and I requested a statement of the amount owed. I received a letter response from Chase on XX/XX/XXXX wherein they only stated that they reported an outstanding debt. I replied to that letter on XX/XX/XXXX to inform them that they have misinterpreted the issue and gave them 30 days to resolve the issue, but I received the same form letter in response on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received a collection call from Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, wherein the caller, XXXX, stated that they had sent a bill to the incorrect address. During the term of my lease, I moved to a new address and notified Chase of this move by updating my contact information in my Chase Bank online account more than two years before the termination of the lease. I also listed my new address on the lease termination and vehicle turn-in documentation. My Chase Bank online account lists my current address in my customer profile. Despite this, Chase Bank has apparently sent statements to an incorrect address. 

Chase did not notify me that I owed an amount before it reported that amount delinquent to the credit bureaus and it has continued to report a delinquency.

During this time I wasnt even looking at oher cars because I wanted to know if it would be a good trade in. Im a female and dont know much on cars so I do feel this has something to do with my experience.

At no time did I get any information regarding my trade in and I was there with XXXX kids so when they heard new car the youngest one got excited. So I told the gentleman man that I wasnt thinking of buying a new car but maybe a trade in so he called the salesman that was there and quickly we were already walking out to the lot so he asked what kind of cars I like and I told him I love my car just that I would like to know if its be a good time to trade it in and he said for something similar? And so I said yes. Know he showed me like 3 cars then we went back to the office and thats where I started feeling uncomfortable. He took my information such as income etc and after that he said he would check my credit and I said ok thats find Im not going to lose anything. Later he walks out telling me I didnt qualify for their financing because of my credit score. So I asked him for it and he gave me a number completely different than what I had so I asked him to show me the reports and he got up and said he would talk to the manager and never showed me my credit reports or score.

That it would only show as one.

I live ~80 blocks away from this branch, and have a BofA branch within 5 minutes of my home. I have no reason to go to the branch in question. 

I filed a claim with Bank of America, who denied the claim on the following grounds : AUTOMATIC DENIAL because a pin and card were verified. I asked for a review of the decision and specifically asked them to check the video footage of the withdrawal. I also filed a police report with the XXXX and provided the police report number to Bank of America. After receiving this information, they denied the claim again, stating the same reason automatic denial because a pin and card were verified. 

The check fraud department confirmed to me that the video evidence had not been reviewed and the bank is refusing to review the video, stating We refuse to pull the video. Our policy requires that we ONLY PULL VIDEO FOR CLAIMS OVER {$5000.00}. There is nothing further we can do for you. 

I would like to receive back the {$4500.00} that was stolen from my account. Why does Bank of America allow fraud to go unchecked if its under {$5000.00}? 

A detailed timeline of events is below. 

XX/XX/XXXX I noticed a withdrawal of {$4500.00} on my online banking account. Neither my wife nor I had lost our debit cards or our PINs, and we had been home all day. I immediately called Bank of America to report the issue. Since the transaction was still pending they said I needed to call back after it cleared the next day. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called back and filed a formal claim. Bank of America said it would take ~3 months to review the claim, but did not provide any funds during the review. I was forced to bear the burden of the loss throughout the process. 

XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I called the check fraud department several times to check on the status and ask if any further information was needed. Nothing further was requested and no update was provided other than to say the bank still has more time to review the claim. 

XX/XX/XXXX I was notified that the claim was denied on the following grounds : automatic denial because a pin and card were verified. I explained to the check fraud department that the card was cloned and the PIN could have been obtained via a skimmer device. 

I asked if the video footage of the withdrawal was reviewed, which would be a very simple way of conducting the investigation. The agent told me that it was not clear that the video had been reviewed, but that she would escalate the review of the decision and add a note to my account my request to review the video footage of the withdrawal. 

Agent stated it would take another ~1 month to conduct the review of the decision. 

Mid XX/XX/XXXX I called to check in on the status of the claim. I received no update. 

The agent asked if I filed a police report and I said I had not because I wasnt told it would be required. Further, the police have no bearing on whether the bank reimburses me. I was told now ( for the first time ) that the police report is a critical part of the bank 's investigation and would go a long way to resolve the claim. I said I was happy to file a police report if that would help. 

XX/XX/XXXX I had left town for the holidays, but immediately upon my return, I visited the XXXX precinct and filed a formal police report. I provided this information, including the police report number, to BofA immediately. I was told the review was ongoing. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called BofA again because I had not received any communication from them regarding the review. I was told the claim had been denied for the same reason automatic denial because a pin and card were verified. 

I asked the check fraud department agent if the video footage had been reviewed. The agent told me that the video had not been reviewed but that she would ask the analyst reviewing the claim whether they could pull and review the footage while I waited on hold. After 5 minutes, she came back on the phone to tell me the analyst has refused to pull the video. BofAs policy only requires video evidence be pulled for claims over {$5000.00}. There is nothing more we can do for you. 

I informed the XXXX, which stated that this has happened multiple times with Bank of America. In other situations, they actually obtained photographic evidence of the perpetrator and BofA still denied the claim.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BANK OF AMERICA NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,NY,100XX,480228,2258832000000,OCC,1906458000000,218605000000,Washington,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-104

They did not provide me with a valid reason for rejection of my dispute on a transaction. 

I made a purchase with a company and they charged me the wrong amount. I contacted the company and they were unwilling to credit the difference. 

I filed a dispute with Chase and was told that if I did not have a receipt showing the amount that I was supposed to be charged, then I was liable. 

This payment was placed by phone and I never signed or agreed to any documentation to support what I was charged. The merchant responded to my dispute by sending a contract that is signed by the seller but the signature line for the buyer is blank. For some reason Chase took this contract WITHOUT a signature as proof of it being a valid charge. 

I escalated the dispute up the Chase Executive office and was again denied. I was contacted by a XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. She repeated the same as the dispute department that I needed a receipt as proof of what I should have been charged. I asked her that if anyone wanted to be deceitful, they are not going to give any paperwork.

I asked her if she could send me Visa rules or even Chase rules stating such. She refused and then said she would but never did. I called her two different times requesting this information and she never returned by call. 

If this is the rule for credit cards and the general public knew, that would be an end to all credit card use. Who would make a purchase by phone or internet knowing they are liable to whatever amount the merchant charges?

I was approved and my {$100.00} initial deposit was successfully processed at the end of that week.

Few days later, after a {$100.00} ACH direct deposit from another bank posted, I got the {$200.00} advertised bonus.

Then, I withdrew all the money except {$100.00} to keep the account fee free. So, my balance of the end of XX/XX/2018 was {$100.00}.

On XX/XX/2018, Valley National Bank drained my Premier Checking account without any notification at all.

On Monday, XX/XX/2018, I noticed the Premier Checking account has no funds. The automated Valley National Bank withdrawal transaction description was REWARDS CREDITED IN ERROR. I went to the Valley National Bank XXXX  Branch that day and even though I showed screen shots with the web site offer wording, the bank officer told me a recurring qualifying monthly direct deposit of {$1000.00} or more within 90 days was required to receive the {$200.00} cash reward.

Due to the unexpected Valley National Bank reward credit reversal, the account balance was under the {$100.00} minimum required balance for several days and I would be hit with a $ XXXX  monthly maintenance fee if the account remained open by the next statement date Tuesday, XX/XX/2018.

Valley National Bank advertised offer wording was clearly misleading but the way they handled the reward credit reversal was even worse. So, I decided to close the account on Monday, XX/XX/2018.

On XX/XX/2018, I got an e-mail from Valley National Bank in which they recognized the original advertised offer was erroneous and a clear explanation of the {$200.00} bonus requirements was attached. Valley National Bank also offered me to reopen the account so I can get the {$200.00} bonus by meeting the new offer requirements.

Since I was not sure if Valley National Bank will report the cash bonus correctly to the IRS, I decided to wait until I receive their XX/XX/2018XXXX form.

The transfer of my account from the previous company took place and there were no issues with my account balances. 

However, the new bank - Synchrony Bank has a policy in place where they reduce my auto recurring monthly payments when I make additional payments. I had calculated exactly what my payments needed to be monthly to pay off my balance without accruing interest. Then I purchased another item that needed to be paid off after my upcoming bill in order to avoid interest. Instead of changing my monthly recurring payment, I decided to pay additional amounts as one time payments and I pre-scheduled them online to be once a week. I received a letter in the mail in XX/XX/XXXX from Synchrony Bank saying they had decreased my recurring payment based on the one time payment I had made. I chatted with a representative online who told me that is how this system works. It seems unethical to me that my payment would be reduced when I choose to make additional payments. That has never happened to me, not with the previous bank nor any other bank I have had a credit card with. 

On my XX/XX/XXXX invoice I was charged interest because they reduced my payment amount without my permission. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX and they resolved my account by removing the interest charge. I received another letter in XX/XX/XXXX where they reduced my recurring monthly payment again. It has not yet posted to my account and the representative can not assist me.

I have made the 180 payments in good faith and the loan is now paid off.

But still Bank of the west has done great harm to my credit.

The situation is entirely their fault and I am seeking a remedy.

In XX/XX/2018 my RV loan with Bank of the West matured. I was sent a notice stating such.

The notice simply stated that the loan had matured and offered no other details. I was a bit confused because I still had payment coupons left in my payment book. I called the XXXX number for customer assistance to clarify the situation and get a payoff amount. I was told by the agent that the payoff amount was just over 4000 dollars. I was also advised by the Bank of the West agent that I could simply continue making the standard monthly payment and that would bring down the principal balance to a point where it was palatable to payoff. No mention of credit bureau reporting was made. So I continued to make the standard monthly payment.

I also continued to receive notices that payment had been received.

I thought everything was fine and planned to payoff the loan once the payoff amount was down to XXXX dollars.

In XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice from Bank of the West that the bank was about to report a charge off ( default ) to the credit bureaus. I immediately called to get the payoff amount and make the final payment.

The loan is now paid in full but Bank of the West has nearly destroyed my credit. They have reported my loan to the bureaus as 60 and 90 days late, this was NEVER indicated to me in either verbal or written communications.

At this point Bank of the West has all of their money and interest, I have the RV, but my credit is ruined.

Nor have I been given an explanation of why after 180 payments there was still a XXXX dollar balance.

I think the best way of resolving this issue is for Bank of the West to remove the derogatory credit items from the credit bureaus and restore my credit score. I would also like a detailed accounting of why the payoff amount was so high.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BANK OF THE WEST,CA,928XX,804963,96057998000,STATE,79777375000,14025894000,San Francisco,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-7

I was financed with huntingon bank, I immediately called insurance got a claim started that night - insurance and gap got started paying it off and started communications with Huntington bank to get the card fully paid off, in the mean time, I had to finalize my divorce and was changing jobs - but was able to go get a new lease for a lower payment on another XXXX. Insurance and gap and I were all communicating, along with Huntington to ensure it was all paid off. From what I understood gap was covering the rest of the finances amount, so it was all to be paid off. Well I got a call from Huntington about a balance, I called insurance and gap and they said they would communicate with them to get it paid and for me not to worry about it. 

Well then I get a 30 day report showing from them on my credit for {$450.00} - meanwhile Im a newly divorced single mother trying to sell my house and get a new home that is within the mile distance allowed from my ex husband. That tanked my credit and put me under qualifying. I called them to see what happened and they said gap had sent in the payment late but it didnt cover {$450.00}, and then they told me as of the day i called, XX/XX/XXXX i believe, that I was 60 days late. 

Now I know {$450.00} doesnt sound like a lot But when you are newly divorced, now make $ XXXX and not your salary you were used to AND youre having to move, and a mom paying expenses for kids - {$450.00} is a lot. 
I asked to do a payment plan, or have a rewrite - they denied me and started having condescending tones asking me what changed and why couldnt I pay all the sudden, and that gap had not covered it for the total loss car for this amount and it was left to me. They told me I could make small payments, but they would consistently report me late. 
I let them know I wasnt even aware this was a balance left, & gap & insurance told me stop communicating with them because they were handling it. 
I ended up having to pull favors from friends to rally the money to pay them and begged them not to report me 60 days late.

Please note ; In the United States, a mortgage note ( also known as a real estate lien note, borrower 's note ) is a promissory note secured by a specified mortgage loan. Mortgage notes are a written promise to repay a specified sum of money plus interest at a specified rate and length of time to fulfill the promise. It's the promissory note that contains the promise to repay the amount borrowed. ( Learn more about promissory notes. ) While a promissory note is basically an IOU that contains the promise to repay the loan, the contractual agreement is the document that pledges the property as security for the loan.

( c ) If tender of payment of an amount due on an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligation of the obligor to pay interest after the due date on the amount tendered is discharged.

Dear Manager ; I am notifying you of issues with the information on my credit report. I am curious as to how you are allowed to report this information. With a little research, I found out that I have some rights in place. This letter will serve as a formal dispute under FACTA section 312.

Please take note that I have already dealt with the so called investigation process that the bureaus claim to have completed. Nonetheless, I now wish to exercise my rights to dispute this account directly with you.

I would like to dispute the inaccurate reporting of the above account. Please verify the following : That all balances and amounts are reporting correctly.

That all dates are reporting correctly and that any prior pay history you are reporting is correct Please remove this account from my credit report immediately! It has caused quite bit of damage. I want to point out that you are legally liable for any erroneous information as decided in XXXX vs. XXXX XXXX. This case set a legal precedent that a consumer can sue you for reporting inaccurate information on their credit report. I demand that you remove this account immediately.

XXXX XXXX  required me to be in XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and one two weeks out of every month for the remainder of the year. 

I maintained my residence in XXXX and never moved to Michigan. I stayed at a hotel for the entire month of XXXX and then, in order to be more cost effective, I rented a house in XXXX XXXX, which XXXX reimbursed me for. This property was for myself and one other employee who was based out of XXXX. During this same time period, I brought my personal vehicle to XXXX so that I did not have the added expense of renting a vehicle. While XXXX did reimburse me for rental costs, it was more cost effective for me to drive my own vehicle. Not to mention, the insurance was immensely cheaper, and as a XXXX, I was more comfortable in my own truck. 

While it appears that this lawsuit began some time ago, I was just recently notified of same, when my PREVIOUS employer, XXXX XXXX XXXX, sent me a copy of a garnishment notice. I am still unsure as to who the company representing the original creditor is, as in my research I have located confusing and conflicting information showing both XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and at this point am unsure as to who is representing who. 

I have attempted to verify the debt is valid with XXXX XXXX   XXXX ; however, they have been unable to provide me with an original signed contract or billing statements representing the entire time they have indicated this card was in use. 

XXXX XXXX  XXXX did provide me a copy of the judgment they filed, as well as their proof of service. The process servers notes on the Motion and Verification for Alternate Service confirm that it was a male staying at the property when they spoke to the neighbor, "" Neighbor XXXX female at XXXX confirmed address - said HE drives a truck ''. While the process server may in fact have heard a TV on in the property, it was not me staying there at that time. The process server goes on to note that "" defendant has had plenty of time is evading service. '' If evading service means that I was in XXXX, at MY HOME, then I guess that could be construed as an accurate statement. 

The process server then posted the debt lawsuit documents on the door. These documents were NOT in an envelope or concealed in any manner from third party viewing. They were affixed to the front outside door with tape, and were discovered and taken by the landlord, who proceeded to send pictures of each page of the document to the party that was at the property that week, in addition to my work. 

My lease at the property was terminated shortly after this incident occurred. It seemed coincidental at the time, it doesnt any longer. It appears as if my lease was terminated due to the information posted at the property. 

At that point, I was in XXXX working remotely, and was only in XXXX for one week out of every one or two months. For this reason, I did not establish another rental in XXXX. 

The lawsuit, judgment, and any other entries of default that have been filed into a court system in XXXX, should never have occurred as I was never a resident of XXXX  in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. Hence the XXXX  XXXX county license plates and a mailing address in XXXX, XXXX. My state income taxes were also filed as a resident of XXXX, not XXXX. 

On another note, as youll notice, the last 4 pages of the documents they provided to me for verification, are for an entirely different person. I would wager to guess that this person, and every other person they are filing suit against, would be less than pleased to note the obvious carelessness and lack of oversight in their business practices.

I thought I had all my documents, but I was missing my EIN number. XXXX told me I could get the IRS to fax the information to bank. But in the meantime, he could set-up my personal account. While he was doing that, I was looking up the IRS number on my phone. When I got on the IRS web page it would not let me click the number to dial. So, I got XXXX 's sticky note cards on his desk write the number down. 

I call the IRS but shortly hung-up because the lady that was assisting XXXX told me that she another number which was essential the same number I JUST dialed previous. 

I was a bit aggravated because I was already waiting on hold for 7 minutes and I had another appointment to attend XXXX XXXX. I gather my things and left. 

Few hours later I got a call from XXXX asking, I did I accidentally grip a business card when I was gathering my things? 

So, I search my car, purse, wallet but I didn't see it. I give him a call back to confirm told him I'll be back on Friday to finish the business account. 

Friday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX 2nd try to open the business account. When I arrived, I told the lady at the front desk I wanted to open a business account and I have the IRS on the line to fax my EIN. The lady that was helping me didn't even know the bank had a fax machine. The was the 1st flag! The IRS confirm the fax was sent the 2 lady claimed they didn't receive it. So they provide me with another fax number the IRS confirmed again it was send. The lady received it but didn't see my personal profile set-up yet and XXXX had to finish it to gain credit for the account. 2nd red flag! I was under the impression XXXX set-up my personal account on Tuesday as he stated ... ... 

I go to XXXX 's desk. He asked me look through my purse again for the business card. I did and I found it in my wallet mixed in with the other business cards, I apologized and gave it back to him. In my mind it was a total accident. No big deal. Suddenly, the lady from Tuesday that give me the same number for the IRS comes over and accuses me of stealing a business card and needed an explanation. I told it was a total mistaken it was NOT intentional. XXXX and this lady when back and forth with me over a BUSINESS CARD of a PERSON I DO NOT KNOW or CARE to KNOW!!!! They were asking why would I do that? Why would I take bank property information? We saw the cameras and saw you put it in your purse. AS IF I WAS A CRIMINAL!!! They made me feel like I was a THIEF and discriminated against! 

I'm TELLING THESE FOLKS IT WAS A PURE ACCIDENT!!!! WHY WOULD WANT BUSINESS CARD FROM SOMEONE I DO NOT KNOW!!! They are in cahoots together saying we are trying to know why too. During this process, I felt harassed and discriminated against. After all of that they asked me are you sure you still want to open your account with us. Red flag number 3!!! Deep inside I didn't because I thought those actions were not called for but .... 

Since I just drove from XXXX XXXX, GA to XXXX, GA during my lunch break, was on hold with the IRS for 35 minutes to get my EIN faxed and I had ALL my paperwork I just needed my account now so I could go! 

They XXXX started acting like my EIN number was not valid even though the IRS JUST FAXED ....

3161202,2019-02-23,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms,"1. On XX/XX/18, a Home Depot Salesperson, XXXX XXXX, signed us up for two home improvement projects ( new rain gutters and a new sliding-glass door/window ). He never provided us receipts for these services nor has Home Depot or their installers, so we have no way of comparing prices to what we see on our Home Depot credit card statement.

2. Also onXX/XX/18 Mr. XXXX called up Home Depot 's Consumer Credit telephone line and signed us up for a Home Depot credit card promising us a 2-year interest-free promotion. He initialed our Consumer Credit Application "" XXXX XX/XX/18 '' and the telephone representative confirmed the 2-year interest-free promotion on these home improvement projects, repeating various times that our call was being recorded for "" quality assurance. '' 3. It took many weary, frustrating months to get Home Depot to schedule the installations of these projects, but they were finally complete just before XXXX  in mid-XX/XX/XXXX ( over 3 months after Mr. XXXX 's sales visit ). Again, we never received receipts or invoices for these repair projects, so we simply have to "" trust '' that our bill is correct. However, the initial bills did NOT honor the promotional 2-years interest-free rate promised us by the salesperson Mr. XXXX, by the telephone consumer credit representative at the time we signed the agreements and application, and even by the Home Depot scheduler over the months it took to get the projects installed.

4. I wrote several complaints about the billing statements not honoring the 2-year interest-free promotional rate without resolution. It appeared a robot was responding to my complaints. I finally had to call the so-called "" Consumer Care '' line during "" business hours '' ( difficult for a full-time working mom/XXXX  ) to resolve the issue, as my bill said it would start accruing interest as ofXX/XX/XXXX ( i.e., 6 months interest-free, not the 24 months that I was quoted at the time of sale and application as well as repeated in calls with the Home Depot scheduler ).

5. Today,XX/XX/XXXX, I sat down to pay my bill that is due in XX/XX/XXXX, and I see that I have acquired a surprise interest charge of {$2.00}. No, it's not a lot, but it is a sneaky fee that makes me again doubt the business practices of this company that has offered my 24-months interest free. I further noticed that this is the first billing statement that warns me of a "" revolving balance '' that can accrue interest. However, this information is buried on page 3 near the end of the statement, i.e., buried beneath all of this information : Summary, Payment Information, Promotional Balances, Advertisements for gift cards, Billing Coupon, Information About Your Account, Key Credit Terms, Change of Address Form, Another Advertisement for Nest, etc.

6. I have never seen a more confusing billing statement, and I have several credit cards and am vigilant about my credit, my debt, and my bills. For example, I have an XXXX XXXX Citi Master Card, a XXXX XXXX American Express Card, and a XXXX XXXX XXXX Visa Card. None of these billing statements from other companies have deceived me. I am confident in accusing Home Depot 's consumer credit card with deceptive business practices. In addition to not honoring quoted promotions, the billing statement buries fees and is difficult to read. It frequently has mistakes and it does not explain what the date or nature of each purchase. Instead of clearly marking a date and citing the transaction with something like HVAC service or window installation, window materials, or window down payment, etc. ; the bill simply lists as follows : "" Revolving Balance NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ. '' 7. To make matters worse, Home Depot and their service providers have provided no receipts for these services, so I have no way of comparing my billing statement to my receipts or invoices. In other words, I am at the mercy of Home Depot 's supposed honor system here, when I have already discovered various mistakes and problems with my bill.

8. It blows my mind that this company has such deceptive and incompetent business practices, and I would NEVER recommend this card to anyone else.

3134017,2019-01-27,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Struggling to pay your bill,Credit card company won't work with you while you're going through financial hardship,"I am on a set income. I have been though a situation which resulted in me being forced to initiate a 3 1/2yr civil matter that ended in XXXX and affected me financially. am still paying the cost of my representation and will continue doing so for the next 2yrs. I have never had such awful money problems. I had been successfully paying my cards off, buying essentials with them and my family would help if any medical problems or the like occured. My father 's workplace shut down and he lost his job early last year. At that point I had no help. In XX/XX/XXXX I missed my first payment to Kohl 's since I opened the account in XXXX. I continued paying everything I could but I could not pay in full after they shot my payment up to over {$120.00}. I contacted them but paid the amount initially thinking it would help, it didn't. Each payment thereafter accrued a higher fee like the inital missed payment. As I said, I contacted Kohl 's via their website message center on the payment page about my missed payment. I explained how long I had been a customer, that I'd been a VIP cardholder for the majority of that time, paid more than asked every chance I got and asked if they could drop the late fee, split it up or lower their "" base '' interest rate. Explained I was struggling and so were my bills but wanted to get back on track. I let them know I was and would keep doing everything I could to keep my bill in good standing. They were far from empathetic. It continued to be like this every time I contacted them, at times the rep acted as if my distress and confusion was humorous. I grew increasingly frustrated, broke and behind on my other bills. I paid as much as I could when I could. Around XXXX I told the rep I was going to be forced to file bankruptcy if I didn't close my longterm account with them which had always been in good standing abd that I did not want to do either but could not keep paying these {$100.00} late fees and my monthly fee, to which they responded they'd just closed the account for me. From then on out I saw no balance changes but increase and was only given the option to pay the full $ XXXX+ owed ( back then ) every time I paid, they were still adding fees to each payment. I continued to maintain contact and attempted to find out why I was being increasingly charged extra each month. I did not find out until I checked my credit report last night after getting an alert from an XXXXand noticing another card had revoked 1/2 of my spendable amount. Around 3mo into this I started getting emails, phone calls and letters claiming to be someone collecting a debt on Kohl 's behalf and asking for full payment of the fee or a payment match option. I researched the option, it was a scam according to people who had tried it. I did not recieve another bill from Kohl 's, I didn't know who I owed but I paid. I just discovered Kohl 's had reported my account as delequint to all 3 credit agencies and is collecting my activity by way of an investigation watch. They have also been making inquiries and claims of ownership under seperate entitiy names for months and a bank I'd never dealt with. It's affected all of my accounts. The information shown regarding XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX payments, amounts, dates and balance they gave XXXX  does not match the information they gave XXXX. I was not able to get my score fron XXXX, I will have to contact them. The initial late payment date was reported, XX/XX/XXXX, but they did not show that as the initial flag. Starting in XXXX they have multiple 30day late months listed in a row, then 90 and then 120. They do not have the same balance/dates on both CRA 's and I do not have the information they gave them. I apparetly DID have a minimum payment option all along which is how they kept hitting me with a fee even after closure because I was still paying as I should have been. They actually claim I had the option of a minimum payment! 13 years I'd spent growing that account. One late fee and apathetic supoort rep later it's gone. The CRA 's accounts show every prior payment was paid. I was told I could reopen the account when I paid the fee off by the rep. I feel like it was just a game to them. On my report the minimum payment of {$120.00} a month shows up after XXXX or thereabouts. I was never told the truth and it makes me extremely angry. This very month it stated {$550.00} as my only payment option. Even though I'm just around {$270.00} over my balance. I would have borrowed money from my now newly hired Father and paid the fee off in 2-3mo if I had been given the chance. Each payment I made attempting to pay the fee carried whatever I did not pay of that hidden {$120.00} over as another late fee. I was intentionally kept in a late, unpaid state. There's no way to deny it. The "" 120 '' day very late adverse account is now on my credit reports along with an insulting lie stating the creditor chose to close the account. Due to this my credit score is dead, other company 's have begun cutting my credit lines and everything 's now being flagged. It's taking my credit score down 5pts a day. I do not believe the incorrect information on file is fair, it's not a true representation of what occurred, nor do I believe the adverse account should have been flagged, I'm paying. I feel as if this was a petty jab made just to bring attention to it and further ruin my credit. I was not given any information apart from being made to think the debt had been sold last year.

I activated this offer, then proceeded to make a {$260.00} on XX/XX/2019 ( see Attachment 1 ). I checked online and was only credited {$9.00}. Chase stated because XXXX broke up my SINGLE transaction into two separate charges ( not sure why they processed this transaction this way, see Attachment 2 ), I was only eligible for {$9.00} instead of {$17.00}. I feel like this is an unfair business practice as the consumer does not control how the merchant processes and ultimately charges customers. I contacted Chase two times, and the first individual said they would refer my complaint to card services. I received notification via mail ( see Attachment 3 ), that I would only be credited {$9.00}. I offered to send my receipt to the credit card company and they did not care. They said I would need to contact XXXX. This offer was made to me through Chase, so I don't understand how XXXX would be responsible for crediting me the remaining {$8.00}. I feel that if this is a standard practice, there are likely other consumers that are also being treated unfairly after spending the required amounts of money to qualify for these offers. This seems like an unfair business practice. I upheld my end of the agreement, used this card for this reason, and was told I would not receive the promised amount. While the amount is arbitrary ( {$8.00} ), it's the practice that I feel is abusive, and as I mentioned earlier, other consumers are likely impacted by this practice. In aggregate, who knows -- XXXX has a large customer base and Chase is probably gaining a large amount of XXXX XXXX Credit Card holders through this relationship. If customers are not actively checking their accounts for credits, they would not know that they were losing money promised to them by the creditor.

This request was done electronically. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the amount of {$12000.00} was received by XXXX-XXXX and applied to my account. 

However, on XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that the Discover balance of {$12.00}, XXXXstill remained, so I contacted Discover to see what the hold-up was. At that point, Discover said that they had NOT received any payment from XXXX-XXXX and requested that I set up an automatic payment with them so I would not miss a future payment. I did this as not to mess with my credit score and in hopes that this would be cleared up soon. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Discover billed me for {$500.00} On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Discover. XXXX put me on hold to review my account, and then transferred me to another department. XXXX then told me that Discover had not received a payment from XXXX-XXXX, and requested that I contact XXXX-XXXX to initiate an investigation into what happened. 

That same day, I contacted XXXX-XXXX. The woman that I spoje with, XXXX, said that the money had to be received by someone and that they would have a resolution for me within 30 days. I was then transferred to another department where I spoke to XXXX who also told me that XXXX-XXXX would investigate where the money went and I would be notified via paper mail. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I recevied a letter from XXXX-XXXX cardmember services stating that the transfer I initiated back in XX/XX/XXXX was applied to my Discover account on XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$12.00}, XXXX ( letter uploaded here ). 

Because there had been no resolution, I began paying DOUBLE - money to Discover and money to XXXX-XXXX - to avoid falling into bad credit. 

Thus, on XX/XX/XXXX, My Discover balance was {$12.00}, XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contact Discover yet AGAIN. I began speaking with XXXX who put me on hold to talk with various departments. I was eventually transferred to XXXX who opened a missing payment case on my behalf. She said that they would have results for me in 15 days, and would reach out to XXXX-XXXX. In the interim, she provided me with a case number and requested that I send the letter XXXX-XXXX sent me on XX/XX/XXXX to Discover 's Payment Research Department. This is did in good faith. She also indicated that a credit would be applied to my account while this issue was being resolved. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX-XXXX  again and spoke with XXXX and then XXXX. Discover wanted additional information on how the money was sent from XXXX-XXXX  to Discover, so I was inquiring about that. XXXX was able to tell me that the money was sent to Discover as a check on XX/XX/XXXX. He provided me with the chek number, the routing number, and the account number. I then called Discover and spoke with XXXX, who I shared the above information with. 

Unfortunately, this information was not good enough for Discover. From my point of view, I have bent over backwards trying to provide information to them regarding this balance transfer. It has caused me nothing but stress and anxiety and yest Discover is the one continuing to benefit from this. Discover reached out vial email ( I have never received a phone call from them ) which stated that the information ( check number, rounting number, etc. ) was not enough and that they needed to see a cleared copy ( front and back ) of the check that was sent from XXXX-XXXX  to Discover. 

So ... once again, on XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX-XXXX. I spoke with XXXX, who said that he would be requesting a copy of the cleared check and have it mailed to me within 7 business days. 

On XXXX, I received an email from Discover stating that since they had not heard back from me, they are assuming that I have taken care of this on my own, and will be returning the balance to my Discover card. 

It is now XXXX, and I have yet to receive any information from XXXX-XXXX. 

I am sick of this run around. I have done my due dilligence, contacting each company month after month since XX/XX/XXXX.

Once ( 2010 yr ) car was delivered to Georgia, my original salesman no longer worked there, a new salesman and manager informs me rate changed and is now 26. 9 %, now required {$800.00} down payment. Sales manager told me I could refinance the  rate because he couldnt get the old one back. I trusted him because he said advised me that was what he did when he purchased his car from XXXX. Unfortunately, I could not refinance the car and the three day return option had expired. The payment I was obligated to make for 73 months is {$590.00}, the loan amount was {$21000.00} including title and transfer fees. I am a single woman who was profiled and discriminated against when XXXX used unfair, deceptive and abusive acts against me. I have been struggling to make this payment to Santander Consumer USA for 3 years. I have made {$18000.00} in payments ( to date ) for this loan and I still owe {$19000.00}. Less than $ {$2000.00} has been applied to the principal balance. My credit is effected by this. I have even lost my job and my home. I have made several complaints to both XXXX for predatory lending and discrimination to no avail. I hold XXXX responsible because they had offered me a lower interest rate beforehand and when I arrived I was pressured to buy now or XXXX could not hold the car for me. I did not understand this since I had waited for the car to be delivered from another state. I also traded in my vehicle I owed a title loan on. I was only given the amount of the title loan for my trade. I also believe this was unfair and deceptive. The payment amount provided when using their ( XXXX ) calculator was {$540.00}, on their website, using the same terms, is less than my required payment. Santander not XXXX does not explain truth in lending as required to consumers. I now understand Santander has been charging me the usurious interest rate 27.9 % plus that of % 13.99 each day for simple interest. XXXX did not show me my credit scores, so I pulled them as was advised car dealers repeatedly pulled my score in order to lower the score in order for their system to increase to the rate they gave me.

My concern is that I do not trust that there was any technical issue at all.

The amount was minimal, but it was wrong. I should not have to contact the company, wait for 11 minutes on a chat session for a proposed resolution. I should not have to police this company to be sure that they are not taking advantage of me. 

I am awaiting a credit reversal for the interest and will need to watch all future statements to make sure that I am not taken advantage of again.
