It should be noted it was only on XXXX. We contacted XXXX & Wells Fargo bank to report the fraudulent accounts. They did confirm it was my SS # on file but with someone elses name, DOB, and address. We filled out fraud forms, send police report number, and copies of credit reports. On XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX I received letters from both Wells Fargo & XXXX stating it was discovered to be identity theft and they would have the 3 credit bureaus remove from my credit file. I also placed a freeze on my credit files. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a few voicemails from SS office stating my identity may have been compromised yet again. I pulled credit reports again and was shocked to see XXXX  is reporting my file as XXXX XXXX XXXX, his DOB, Addresses, XXXX XXXX is running inquiries ( I dont have ), Wells Fargo credit card is showing closed as of XX/XX/XXXX, last payment XX/XX/XXXX, shows consumer disputes, and last reported XX/XX/XXXX. None of this is mine and was to be removed. 

This person is clearly using my SS # according to XXXX & Wells Fargo. XXXX did their job and removed it for Fraud. Wells Fargo has not. How did a large national bank such as Wells Fargo allow someone to open a credit card in my name without the proper verification. Clearly the other persons name and DOB ( XX/XX/XXXX ) does not match my SS #. Where is the verification on that?

3169014,2019-03-04,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,NA,"I am filing this complaint after receiving a letter from Chase today alleging a lie to cover up their illegal activities. In the letter ( see attachment ) dated XX/XX/XXXX Chase asserted that we cant consider you for mortgage assistance because we didnt receive your initial request by the required number of days before the scheduled foreclosure date. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE. I REPEAT. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE, AND I CAN PROVE IT! 
Chase has repeatedly made false allegations like this to us for more than four years. Most of the Chase Request for Mortgage Assistance applications we have sent to Chase have been ignored ( see attachment ). Nonetheless, In XX/XX/XXXX, our Chase dedicated relationship manager in XXXX, Florida spoke to the Chase branch bank manager and vice president in XXXX, Georgia. He ( the vice president ) told her ( our dedicated relationship manager ) that he personally faxed all of our documents to her the previous week and confirmed their receipt in her office at that time. In spite of this fact, she requested through the branch bank vice president that we submit our application and all required documents to her again for the 33rd time in 18 months ( see attachment ). Consequently, our dedicated relationship manager sent to our home address a XXXX envelope for us to submit our application and documents back to her again. We sealed the documents in that envelope and took it back to the Chase branch bank so that Chase employees could send it to her through XXXX. 
The Chase branch bank in XXXX, Georgia took receipt of our envelope of documents and gave them to XXXX. XXXX tracking confirms that our application was received by our dedicated relationship manager in her actual office on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( see attachment ). After that date, we never heard from our dedicated relationship manager again regarding ANY aspect of our application. 
Chase proceeded in XXXX to schedule a foreclosure on our property for XX/XX/XXXX in violation of the laws of our state for multiple reasons, including failure to provide proper notification as required by law. As such, this proves the statement made by Chase to us in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX is a lie because we submitted our Request for Mortgage Assistance application to Chase more than thirty days before Chase took illegal action to attempt a foreclosure on the date of XX/XX/XXXX. Our "" dedicated relationship manager '' failed to process our application despite our having previously submitted it to her in XX/XX/XXXX, and well as on 32 previous occasions in the past 18 months.",NA,JPMORGAN CHASE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,GA,305XX,852218,3025285000000,OCC,2253482000000,270060000000,Washington,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-37

I was unable to log into my account online to make the payment because Macy 's had updated the system and I simply did n't have the patience to navigate their irritating and obscure system. However, I called Macy 's and paid my bill for $ XXXX a day or two late - was assured that there would be no late charges because I was a customer in good standing, yada yada, and received a confirmation number that I had paid the bill in full. 

I then received a bill for {$2.00} in interest. OK, I agree - I had n't paid the {$140.00} on time, regardless of the reason. Whatever. So I paid that {$2.00} bill immediately, by check, and left the country for an extended absence - in complete confidence that I had paid all my bills in full. 

Imagine my surprise when I returned to the US and found that Macy 's had received and cashed my check, but charged me a further {$2.00} anyway as a minimum interest charge on the interest charge that had been paid in full, well before the due date. Oh, and then added a further minimum {$2.00} charge for a total of {$4.00}, due on XXXX. 

I called Macy 's right away and spoke to one XXXX, who did n't seem to have a clue why I was irritated, but eventually - very grudgingly and with full implication that I was a total deadbeat - agreed that she would "" waive '' the {$4.00}.

Before doing so Barclay Card assured me that she could be a user and that it would have no impact on her credit. Only I was responsible for all charges on the account. She never signed anything. I asked for her to be added as an authorized signer to my account. BarclayCard sent her a card of her own to use. About XX/XX/XXXX she was finished with her need to use my credit card and I removed her as a user. 

She went to check her credit bureau the other day and found Barclay Card to be reporting MY full balance to her credit report. She called Barclay Card and they said they could not talk with her about it since she is not a signer on the account. I called Barclay Card to have it corrected and they said that I had to submit letter, via regular mail, and all of the supporting documentation to have my daughters credit reporting reversed. 

Their fraudulent mistake is not my problem to fix. Barclay Card acknowledges that they should not be reporting on my daughters credit report. They should not have reported it to her credit bureau while she was using the card and they certainly should not be reporting it now. However, they said they will maintain the fraudulent reporting unless I write them a letter with all the required documentation to have it removed.

Specifically, Chase limited the number of guests allowed with the XXXX  XXXX airline lounge benefit and also disallowed points earning on the {$300.00} in travel charges each year that normally result in travel credits. 

Under the terms of the agreement, I could refuse to accept these changes - which I did. I called Chase to request that my card type be changed to one without an annual fee and that the annual fee be refunded. 

Despite making this request 4-5 times, the request was not processed.

They stated they canceled the balance owed on XX/XX/XXXX and issued a XXXX. and as a result updated charge off balance to {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and reported to credit bureaus on XX/XX/XXXX.

Further they state they carefully reviewed the account and did not find any misrepresentations, unfair tactics or tried to be deceiving.

And that they are required to report accurately.

The problem with these statements are my credit report shows a charge off in the payment history on XX/XX/XXXX. Then the next data entry shows a charge off on XX/XX/XXXX.

The status shows a balance update and status of charge off update to be XX/XX/XXXX when they clearly said in the letter the balance was canceled on XX/XX/XXXX. If the balance is {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX it should state XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX.

The next problem is the XXXX they furnished in the letter and sent to the irs shows an identifiable event code of ( F ) By Agreement. This would have to mean that I made an agreement with them to cancel the debt owed for less than the full balance. This would be false.

The date of the Identifiable event is XX/XX/XXXX. Considering the Irs regulations prior to XX/XX/XXXX. If a debt has not been paid for 36 months and active collection is not pursued then a XXXX is to be issued even if the debt is not discharged. The account was delinquent prior to XX/XX/XXXX and closed and charged off XX/XX/XXXX. A XXXX should have been issued prior to XX/XX/XXXX. So in this case the XXXX was issued in the wrong year with incorrect event coding Finally according to XXXX  county land records there was a mortgage assignment filed for this account. The Assignment of mortgage was not to Chase Home Finance nor Chase Home Lending. Which gives reason to believe the incorrect creditor is reporting the debt and that they do not have a valid claim. Whether the Assignment of mortgage is valid is speculative considering the notary had been suspended and the agent on behalf of Chase may or may not have worked for Chase.

My actions have been contacting Chase about the misrepresentations and they have stated the account has been charged off since XX/XX/XXXXbut it is still open and they are reporting correctly.

I disputed with Credit Reporting Agencies to validate the information which is clearly incorrect. The came back that they only report what they are told to and that it was validated.

I have submitted a prior complaint to CFPB which contacted Chase which responded with the letter that I have explained.

I have continually ran into problems getting credit due to this account reporting the charge off as XX/XX/XXXX since Derogatory Credit waiting periods require 4 years though the Charge Off had occurred XX/XX/XXXX.

Initially I was unable to use my card for several months upon credit approval. Several attempts to contact hsbc and several hours of being put on hold and hung up on lead to my initial complaint.

Now, I have completed the online banking months ago as well to manage my account. HSBCs initial classificationof my account has caused me not to have the ability to log on, I have also stopped receiving paper letters in the mail showing me my statement. Since opening I have made one payment over the phone for the complete balance. However now I do not know the remaining payments or due dates which is preventing me to make my payment and ensure I have a XXXX  balance. 

I hurt my credit by opening this account with the intention of using rewards points, benefiting from the annual match of points, using my rewards points, and benefiting from the 0 % transfer. 

I was forced to open an additional card to perform the balance transfer, further harming my credit score. I am unable to use my rewards points because I can not log online. I have been prevented from using my card for several months limiting the benefit I would receive in rewards points and more importantly the annual match. I can not make a payment on this account due to unknown balances which I have never had a late payment and am afraid this may occur due to the mismanagement of opening this account. 

In addition to the hours spent already in the aforementioned complaint I spent additional hours trying to fix my online banking issues.

I have recorded conversations with bank employees, recorded with their consent, explicitly stating that the feature was removed due to low funding levels in my account, though no official guidelines were ever presented to me, despite multiple requests. My complaint is split into two parts : 1. ) Chase Bank utilized predatory tactics to remove mobile deposit from consumers who would most benefit from the feature. I was forced to incur heavy overdraft fees, many of which were returned when bank employees agreed that fees were caused exclusively due to the removal of that feature. After multiple instances when the bank agreed with my complaints and reversed fees, they continued agreeing but no longer had the capacity to reverse the charges. In one instance, when the city of XXXX was completely flooded and no street access existed to banks or atms, I was still charged a fee, even when I showed the ability to make a deposit as soon as the streets became accessible. Instances such as this occurred on numerous occasions, and each time employees told me that my feature had been removed due to a history of overdrafts, which was entirely created as a result of the removal, itself. This policy of removing the feature for customers with low or negative balances puts us into a purposeful loop of overdraft fees, which bank employees acknowledged as a known problem. 

2. ) I asked on numerous occasions to be given written or formal guidelines about my rights, as a consumer to utilize the mobile deposit feature. While in my recordings bank employees give vastly different answers about the terms of use, none could provide me with clear written rules. Who qualifies for that feature? When will mine be turned on? Why was the feature removed as a result of overdraft fees? All indicated that the feature was removed due to low funds or overdrafts, but none could explain why removal came as a consequence of those facts. Several employees agreed that this was an unfair practice and indicated that numerous customers called in with similar complaints over time. The second portion of my complaint is thus about the bank 's lack of transparency about customer terms of use. 

My recorded conversations with employees are from XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/2016, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, and XX/XX/16.

This overdrew my account on the following Tuesday and because I was out of town and not working at the time, I had to wait 2 weeks for a paycheck to bring my account back to balance. I accrued over a XXXX dollars in overdraft and NSF fees and have records to prove this. I called PNC multiple times and asked of anything could be done to stop this with zero help. I was transferred to a supervisor department after the 1st employees claimed they could not reverse any of the fees as the system would not let them. The phone rang once and I got an automated message that said no one was available and the call automatically ended. Never called back. Accepting that they would not budge to work with me or help me at all, I paid the fees and brought my account back to positive and moved on. 

Fast forward to today. The company I work for has decided to switch to biweekly pay instead of weekly. These past 2 weeks on one weeks pay have been awful and stressful. However, we managed to make it to Thursday XX/XX/19 without overdrawing. My account was negative XXXX dollars on Thursday XX/XX/19. When I woke up on Friday XX/XX/19 my account was negative XXXX because of a few small transactions that went through and XXXX dollars in overdraft fees 3 XXXX  dollar charges each. So, my paycheck finally hit the account for XXXX dollars on Friday XX/XX/19. Then at XXXX on Saturday XX/XX/19 I was charged 3 more XXXX dollar overdraft fees after my paycheck had already hit the account. Because my paycheck has gone through I did not expect this. I have so many bills coming out this week from having to wait 2 weeks to get paid, that I can not afford XXXX dollars in overdraft fees. This is my whole grocery budget for the next 2 weeks until I get paid again and I literally have no food in my apartment. I called again today XX/XX/19 asking for assistance in this especially because my paycheck had hit and there is no reason for the fees to be met with no help again and told I should use tips to avoid overdrafting. Enough is enough of this. Ive paid so much in overdraft fees that I can't afford to live. All I want was the 3 most recent overdraft fees refunded to me so I can afford groceries so I don't starve without over drafting again and having the same thing happen while I wait another 2 weeks to get paid. I have exhausted all options to avoid this. I have overdraft protection on my account. I have alerts sent to me when my account drops below XXXX dollars. The way PNC does their business makes it impossible to avoid this because it happens over night while you are sleeping and then to offer no solution to a good, 6 year customer is frustrating and disheartening.",NA,PNC BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,WI,531XX,817824,463097309000,OCC,380920825000,46007120000,Washington,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-33

I did not ask for this to happen, neither did I want to do business with M & T Bank, although I realized the sale was legal. 

The email notice said that I "" would not have to change any of the terms '' of my payments and simply continue as I had been doing, the only change being payments made to M & T Bank rather than XXXX. On Friday, XX/XX/2019, I received a 2nd email notice from M & T Bank basically stating the exact same thing. 

For the last 5 or more years, I had been making my XXXX XXXX payments through my XXXX XXXX Bill Payment System ( see attachments ). Payments were being made at least twice a month or every two ( 2 ) weeks consistently. I have NEVER made payments late in over 10 years with any mortgage payment and usually make the 2nd payment in a month ( prior month to due date ) at least 1 to 3 days early. My wife and I earn over {$180000.00} per year and do not have any issues making any debt payment!

At the time the transfer became effective, I had already paid XXXX XXXX  for the month of XXXX as I always due before the end of the previous month. M & T Bank sent me a bill not giving me credit for XX/XX/2019 payments that had already been made to XXXX XXXX prior to the transfer. Secondly, since I thought this was an error, I waited for a corrected statement. Instead, I received a pass due notice when my XXXX payment was not even due! 

I called M & T Bank on last Friday, XX/XX/2019 and explained everything above to the representative. Instead of assisting me with the issue, she kept giving me the run around and telling me that I had "" to change the way I was paying by logging on and signing up for their every-two-week payment bank draft ''. This was a direct contradiction to what I had been guaranteed in writing that I would NOT have to change the way I had been paying my mortgage properly for years. Secondly, she did nothing to bring my mortgage account current as it should be. 

Lastly, I just received by mail another pass due notice stating that I owe {$2900.00}, when in fact, I OWE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! The M & T Bank bill also included some {$920.00} "" Hazard Disbursement '' amount, which has never appeared on any previous mortgage bill, and they never explained it to me. 

My payments are current, and documentation is attached to prove it! If I were not late with XXXX XXXX, how could I now be late with M & T Bank when I have continued to make all payments twice a month or even every two weeks right through their transfer of mortgage process, for which again, I did not ask nor desire? 

This is absolutely ridiculous, and I expect the federal government to take the strongest possible action against this bank. They did not even listen to me or even try to correct the situation. I have been a perfect customer, I always pay all bills on time ( my credit score proves that ), and I will not tolerate this harassment in the lease.

I took out two mortgages for the condo at 80 % on first and 20 % on second. XXXX XXXX was an operating sub of XXXX and both were taken over by Bank of America in XXXX. 

In XXXX I was contacted by Bank of America via mail that I was eligible for loan modifications under the HAMP program. I contacted the using the number on the letter. The agent that I spoke to informed me that I would be eligible but first I needed to quit paying my mortgages. She stated that I needed to contact her in 3 months after non-payment. 

In three months the agent informed me that she would be sending out a modification package in the mail. Upon receiving it I filled it out and she informed me to continue to not pay my mortgages. Several months later in XXXX I received my modification package. The principal on the mortgage was {$110000.00} which was XXXX higher than the original 1st. I asked the agent about the 2nd mortgage and if I would be getting another bill. She replied that as far as she was concerned the 2nd was finished and that I was to ignore any and all bills for the property except the one sent by bank of america. She additionally stated that I would be receiving information in the future settling the 2nd mortgage and that it was going to be extinguished and discharged. She stated that I would be receiving a XXXX for the difference if there was one. 

During the modification process all financial adjustments and payments were reported on bills that were consistent with the XXXX XXXX XXXX statements. Upon completion of the trial period and upon transferring over to bank of america bills for the mortgage I received a statement from XXXX XXXX with regards to the 2nd mortgage that showed that the balance was adjusted to XXXX. It was dated in conjunction to the billing reflected on the first mortgage and the bank of america modification. 

I never received any bill with regard to the 2nd mortgage after the modification was completed. 3-4 years later I received a bill in the mail from a third party company that has been trying to collect. I emphatically deny the legitimacy of this debt. 

At the recorder of deeds it shows that the deed of trust assignment for the first mortgage was transferred to bank of america in XXXX of XXXX yet the 2nd mortgage has remained unchanged since XXXX. 

Upon conducting a title search it is clear that bank of america owns the 2nd mortgage still. I have tried to reach out via phone and email to bank of america only to get canned responses. 

I understand that in the early days of HAMP bank of america was contracting with third party companies to administrate the modifications. I also understand that these companies had poorly trained staff. I speculate that it is quit possible that while the third party organized the information and handed it back to bank of america that it is likely that the documentation was lost or incorrectly filed and that the 2nd mortgage was sold as an unsecured debt to a third party. 

I understand that in XXXX there was a settlement with the department of justice in which bank of america had to correct and amend several decisions that it had made as its practices were in violation of the HAMP program. I would greatly appreciate if Bank of America would take the necessary steps to reply to these issues responsibly so that this can come to a close.

The dispute came from fees they assessed against my account. I always pay my bill in full, and they suddenly charged over {$50.00} in interest one month. I discovered later that they did this because they accidentally posted a payment on my account, and they charged me interest for three months from the time they posted the payment until they discovered the error. During these 3 months, I had been paying the full amount on my bill by the due date. 

When I discovered Barclays ' error, I made the payment in the amount that they had posted, but I contested the amount of interest because it was not my fault.

'' I stopped using my Barclays credit card, started making arrangements to get a new credit card, and I used {$75.00} in "" rewards '' to reduce my balance. Then, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that stated that they had posted {$29.00} in "" interest charge-purchases '' on my account on XX/XX/XXXX. The amount was the balance on my account, not the fees/interest that Barclays had charged on my account. Regardless, upon receiving that letter, I wrote a check in amount of {$29.00}, returned my credit card, and asked them to close my account, with the hope that I would no longer deal with Barclays.

OnXX/XX/XXXX, Capital One then simultaneously refunded me the three charges of {$110.00}, {$110.00} and {$85.00} while additionally charging me three charges of {$110.00}, {$110.00} and {$85.00}. In effect, I was still charged the money that was supposed to be returned.

The last call was XX/XX/XXXX. The fraud agents name was XXXX. Her ID # was XXXX. She told me that everyone else was wrong and that it takes an entire billing cycle to fix this problem.

The billing cycle ended XX/XX/XXXX, approximately one month after I placed my fraud report. I paid the bill in full. No action has been taken to refund my money.

When you call the fraud line you have to talk to someone before being put through to a fraud agent. I asked the person who put me through to XXXX  on the final call to file a complaint on my behalf. He told me that he did ; although, I have not heard anything about it from Capital One. Each phone call with Capital One takes at least 40 minutes. I do not have time to keep calling them just to hear why they can not follow their own protocol.

I would like for XXXX XXXX to refund the money to my account or to send me a check for the money owed. The money owed is the difference between the three XXXX charges ( {$110.00}, {$110.00} and {$85.00} ) and the two XXXX credits ( {$44.00} and {$44.00} ). This equals {$220.00}.",NA,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORP,MD,208XX,112837,363521558000,OCC,303536222000,42232353000,Washington,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-58

I already disputed this with the credit bureaus and they verified it as being accurate. I am not sure how this happened, I |thought that I had made my payments to you on time when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me or maybe an error occurred where it wasn't recorded on time. 

I do ask in light of the good standing relationship we have that you remove any late payments from my credit report and refund me any late fees that were added to my account. I do not believe it is accurate. 

I would rather not have to spend more time than necessary for both of us to resolve this situation so I was hoping that instead of escalating anything, that you could help me with this and report me as being 100 % on time. 

I appreciate your help regarding this and look forward to keep having the positive experience that I have had with you in the past.

At that time, it was winter going into spring, in XXXX New York. Therefore, I was behind in the heat and electricity, the car loan, and owed back payments in child support.

We are seniors and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX MA XXXX, has been our primary residence since XX/XX/XXXX. We purchased our home on no doc through Washington Mutual. Chase took over the loan in XX/XX/XXXX and we refinanced from a 30 year fixed to a 15 year fixed mortgage Chase in XX/XX/XXXX. At the closing, Chase asked if we wanted a $ XXXX line of credit. We elected to accept only $ XXXX at the time, which was not accessed until XX/XX/XXXX. In  late XX/XX/XXXX, Chase invited us to increase our HELOC line from the $ XXXX to $ XXXX, but at an increase of 2 % on the entire balance. Going through the financial crisis causing negative Government effect on my FCC Broadcast ownership, XXXX and XXXX children in college, we accepted going forward with the new terms. Chase then delayed for months stating our home value decreased and despite adequate funds in the bank and questioned amount of money I was taking from my owned radio station XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MA. In XX/XX/XXXX, Chase finally dictated to us that our only option was modification but we had to skip two payments to be considered. 

Chase then reported us to the credit bureaus and the modification approval for the stated 60 months finally came in XX/XX/XXXX, but extended only 42 months with a balloon payment for the full mortgage due XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, Chase miscoded a bank routing number on a payment and then took months to determine it was their error. Then, Chase interrupted our applications for new financing by starting foreclosure notices. Chase further delayed and hindered our efforts to change lenders. 

Finally, after finally being put in touch with the Chase Executive Office in XX/XX/XXXX,  Chase agreed, in XX/XX/XXXX to a second modification at our out of pocket cost of {$36000.00}. Chase refused to spread that amount over the ensuing 200 payments in the second modification. 

In both XX/XX/XXXX and upon our XX/XX/XXXX approval of the second modification, Chase promised to A ) adjust late fees, interest charges and legal fees, B ) make sure the credit bureaus knew we were up to date on the mortgage & HELOC, C ) correct Chases superficial appraisal of our home which is at least $ XXXX too low - $ XXXX compared to a complete modification performed by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at $ XXXX - and D ) make arrangements to finally add to our line of credit. E ) The rate of interest on the new modification is quite high, 4.87 %. 

We continue to get lip service, run around, rude correspondence and phone conversation from Chase. The letters they have sent to me and your offices have no credibility as they do not address Chase mistakes and the horrible, inappropriate manner of customer service from Chase. The Chase letters repeat their old decisions that were incorrect in the first place. 

We are seniors, never bankrupt, with a Chase debt of less than $ XXXX on our primary/only residence HUD and the CPB valued several months ago at over {$1.00} million. Chase is disregarding the importance of our Senior Financial Health and discriminating against seniors ability to have simple access to less than 49 % of their home equity for medical, improvement, college and living expenses. Further, Chase has been rude and tremendously challenged in delaying proceedings. Chase representatives stall, take months to say its not this department and have told us to find another lender, get a reverse mortgage or move! 

With a tremendous amount of phone, email, letter, fax correspondence shared with your offices and Chase, I must ask that you now step in and hold Chase accountable for this harmful, stressful, prolonged and costly behavior negatively affecting us, and other senior customers. We ask for all fee and interest adjustments and for a favorable arrangement to have access to up to 49 % of our home FMV, without further delay.
